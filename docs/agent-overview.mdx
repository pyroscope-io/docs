## Overview

**Pyroscope Server**.

## Supported platforms

**Pyroscope Agent** can run on [Linux](agent-install-linux), [macOS](agent-install-macos), [Windows](agent-install-windows)
and in <FontAwesomeIcon color="#0db7ed" icon={faDocker}/> Docker. Note that some integrations are OS-specific.
Visit [Integrations](/docs/supported-integrations) page for details.

## Run modes

**Pyroscope Agent** may be run interactively and as a service:
 * `pyroscope exec` spawns a new process and attaches configured profiler. Once `pyroscope exec` exits, the child
process exits as well and vice-versa. This command may be used for testing, as a docker entrypoint, or as a systemd
service unit command.

 * `pyroscope connect` attaches profiler to already running process specified by PID or operating system,
if applicable (for example, `ebpf` integration).

 * `pyroscope agent` continuously tracks configured `targets` and attaches profilers to them. This command is
primarily supposed to be run in the context of a service manager such as systemd or Windows Service Control Manager.

Refer to [Configuration](/docs/agent-configuration-overview) page to learn more about each mode and how to configure
**Pyroscop Agent**.
