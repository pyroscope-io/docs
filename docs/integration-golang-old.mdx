**Go** is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
Pyroscope uses the standard `runtime/pprof` package to collect profiling data. Refer to
[the official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/diagnostics#profiling) for details.

### Profiling Go application

To start profiling a Go application, you need to include our go module in your app. Here's a code snippet:

```go
package main

import "github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/pkg/agent/profiler"

func main() {
  profiler.Start(profiler.Config{
    ApplicationName: "simple.golang.app",

    // replace this with the address of pyroscope server
    ServerAddress:   "http://pyroscope-server:4040",

    // by default all profilers are enabled,
    // but you can select the ones you want to use:
    ProfileTypes: []profiler.ProfileType{
      profiler.ProfileCPU,
      profiler.ProfileAllocObjects,
      profiler.ProfileAllocSpace,
      profiler.ProfileInuseObjects,
      profiler.ProfileInuseSpace,
    },
  })

  // your code goes here
}
```
