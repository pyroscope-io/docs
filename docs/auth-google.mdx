To enable Google OAuth2 you must register your application with Google. Google will generate a client ID and secret key for you to use.

## Create Google OAuth keys

First, you need to create a Google OAuth Client ID:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.
1. Click "Create Credentials", then click "OAuth Client ID" in the drop-down menu
1. If this is your first time creating a client ID, you can also configure your consent screen by clicking Consent Screen. ([The following procedure](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#userconsent&zippy=%2Cuser-consent) explains how to set up the Consent screen.) You won't be prompted to configure the consent screen after you do it the first time.
1. Enter the following:
    * Application Type: Web Application
    * Name: Pyroscope
    * Authorized Redirect URLs: https://pyroscope.mycompany.com/auth/google/callback
    * Replace https://pyroscope.mycompany.com with the URL of your Pyroscope instance.
1. Click Create
1. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the "OAuth Client" modal


## Enable Google OAuth in Pyroscope

Specify the Client ID and Secret in the Pyroscope configuration file. For example:

```
auth:
  google:
    enabled: true
    client-id: CLIENT_ID
    client-secret: CLIENT_SECRET
    allowed-domains:
      - mycompany.com
      - myorganization.org
```

See the [server configuration](configuration.mdx) page for more details on the Pyroscope configuration file.

Restart the Pyroscope server. You should now see a Google login button on the login page. You can now login with your Google accounts.
