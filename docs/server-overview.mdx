## Overview

**Pyroscope Server** processes, aggregates, and stores data from agents for speedy queries of any time range.
Later you can look at the profiling data and make queries across any time range for example:
- all of 2020
- that one day last month when the website was slow
- that time you deployed on a Friday night and messed up everything without knowing why

Check out our [Demo Page](https://demo.pyroscope.io/) and select any time range to see how quickly Pyroscope works!
