## HTTP API

### Authentication

When Pyroscope Server [authentication providers](auth-overview.mdx) are configured,
API clients should provide a **Bearer** authentication token in the **Authorization** header, like this:

```
GET http://your.pyroscope.com/render HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer psx-BWlqy_dW1Wxg6oBjuCWD28HxGCkB1Jfzt-jjtqHzrkzI
```

cURL example:
```shell
curl --fail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer psx-BWlqy_dW1Wxg6oBjuCWD28HxGCkB1Jfzt-jjtqHzrkzI" \
  http://localhost:4040/render\?from\=now-1h\&until\=now\&query\=pyroscope.server.cpu%7B%7D\&max-nodes\=1024\&format\=json
```

Please refer to the [API Key Authentication](auth-overview.mdx/#api-key-authentication) paragraph to learn how to create
an API key.

:::note
`/ingest` endpoint authentication is configured separately via the `auth.ingest.enabled` parameter. Please see the
[agent authentication](auth-overview.mdx/#agent-authentication) paragraph for details.

### Ingestion

Currently there's just one endpoint: `POST /ingest`. It takes profile data in request body and metadata as query params.

It takes mutliple query parameters:

| Name         | Description                             | Notes                          |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `name`       | Application Name                        | required, should be url-encoded|
| `from`       | UNIX time of when the profiling started | required                       |
| `until`      | UNIX time of when the profiling stopped | required                       |
| `format`     | format of the profiling data            | optional (default is `folded`) |
| `sampleRate` | sample rate used in Hz                  | optional (default is 100 Hz)   |
| `spyName`    | name of the spy used                    | optional                       |

Request body contains the profiling data.

* `format`. Pyroscope supports different formats, the simplest one is `folded`. With this format you put one stacktrace per line with a number of samples you've captured for that particular stacktrace, for example:

```
foo;bar 100
foo;baz 200
```

* `name` specifies application name. It may be specified in the fully qualified application name notation as described in [the specification](/docs/flameql#notation). For example:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env=staging,region=us-west-1}
```

#### Examples

Here's a sample code that uploads a very simple profile to pyroscope:
<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```shell
printf "foo;bar 100\n foo;baz 200" | curl \
-X POST \
--data-binary @- \
'http://localhost:4040/ingest?name=curl-test-app&from=1615709120&until=1615709130'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

```python
import requests
import urllib.parse
from datetime import datetime

now = round(datetime.now().timestamp()) / 10 * 10
params = {'from': f'{now - 10}', 'name': 'python.example{foo=bar}'}

url = f'http://localhost:4040/ingest?{urllib.parse.urlencode(params)}'
data = "foo;bar 100\n" \
"foo;baz 200"

requests.post(url, data = data)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adhoc support

In [adhoc profiling mode](https://pyroscope.io/blog/pyroscope-adhoc-profiling/) the way Pyroscope works with integrations that use
the HTTP API is as follows:
- Pyroscope starts listening to profiles in an available port.
- Pyroscope sets the environment variable `PYROSCOPE_ADHOC_SERVER_ADDRESS` with the address where its listening.
- Pyroscope launches the profiled application.
- the profiled application sends the profiling data through the HTTP API.

For this to work as expected, the new integrations should check if this environment variable exists and in that case,
they should override the server address with this value. This is enough to make adhoc profiling work seamlessly with the new integration.

How adhoc profiling mode was added to the [java integration](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-java/pull/5) can be used as an example.
