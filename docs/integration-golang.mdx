Pyroscope uses the standard `runtime/pprof` package to collect profiling data. Refer to
[the official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/diagnostics#profiling) for details.

### Profiling Go application



:::important
This current version of the Go integration requires you to run pyroscope server version `0.3.1` or higher.
We strongly recommend you to upgrade your pyroscope server version and use this new version of the golang client. It reduces both the number of dependancies and peformance overhead. The old documentation is still available [here](/docs/golang-old).
:::



To start profiling a Go application, you need to include our go module in your app:
```
# make sure you also upgrade pyroscope server to version 0.3.1 or higher
go get github.com/pyroscope-io/client/pyroscope
```

Then add the following code to your application:

```go
package main

import "github.com/pyroscope-io/client/pyroscope"

func main() {
  pyroscope.Start(pyroscope.Config{
    ApplicationName: "simple.golang.app",

    // replace this with the address of pyroscope server
    ServerAddress:   "http://pyroscope-server:4040",

    // you can disable logging by setting this to nil
    Logger:          pyroscope.StandardLogger,

    // by default all profilers are enabled,
    // but you can select the ones you want to use:
    ProfileTypes: []pyroscope.ProfileType{
      pyroscope.ProfileCPU,
      pyroscope.ProfileAllocObjects,
      pyroscope.ProfileAllocSpace,
      pyroscope.ProfileInuseObjects,
      pyroscope.ProfileInuseSpace,
    },
  })

  // your code goes here
}
```

### Tags

It is possible to add tags (labels) to the profiling data. These tags can be used to filter the data in the UI. We have a custom API that's in line with our other integrations (e.g [Python](/docs/python) or [Ruby](/docs/ruby)) as well as go-native pprof api:

```go
// these two ways of adding tags are equivalent:
pyroscope.TagWrapper(context.Background(), pyroscope.Labels("controller", "slow_controller"), func(c context.Context) {
  slowCode()
})

pprof.Do(context.Background(), pprof.Labels("controller", "slow_controller"), func(c context.Context) {
  slowCode()
})
```



### Pull Mode

Go integration supports pull mode, which means that you can profile applications without adding any extra code. For that to work you will need to make sure you have profiling routes (`/debug/pprof`) enabled in your http server. Generally, that means that you need to add `net/http/pprof` package:
```go
import _ "net/http/pprof"
```


* For information on how to use `net/http/pprof` refer to official [net/http/pprof documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).
* For more information on how to set up pyroscope server to pull data from your applications, refer to [pull mode documentation](/docs/golang-pull-mode).
