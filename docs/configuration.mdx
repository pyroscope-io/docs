There are 3 ways to configure `pyroscope`. Configuration precedence is evaluated in the following order:
* command line arguments
* environment variables
* config files

## Command line arguments

This is the easiest way to configure pyroscope. For the list of command line arguments and default values, run `pyroscope server -help`:

<!-- generate-sample-config:server:md -->
| Name | Default Value | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| adhoc-data-path | OS dependent | Directory where pyroscope stores adhoc profiles. |
| analytics-opt-out | false | Disables analytics. |
| log-level | info | Log level: debug&#124;info&#124;warn&#124;error. |
| badger-log-level | error | Log level: debug&#124;info&#124;warn&#124;error. |
| storage-path | /var/lib/pyroscope | Directory where pyroscope stores profiling data. |
| api-bind-addr | :4040 | Port for the HTTP server used for data ingestion and web UI. |
| base-url |  | Base URL for when the server is behind a reverse proxy with a different path. |
| cache-evict-threshold | 0.25 | Percentage of memory at which cache evictions start. |
| cache-evict-volume | 0.33 | Percentage of cache that is evicted per eviction run. |
| badger-no-truncate | false | Indicates whether value log files should be truncated to delete corrupt data, if any. |
| disable-pprof-endpoint | false | Disables /debug/pprof route. |
| max-nodes-serialization | 2048 | Max number of nodes used when saving profiles to disk. |
| max-nodes-render | 8192 | Max number of nodes used to display data on the frontend. |
| hide-applications | [] | Please don't use, this will soon be deprecated. |
| retention | 0s | Sets the maximum amount of time the profiling data is stored for. Data before this threshold is deleted. Disabled by default. |
| retention-levels | {} | Specifies how long the profiling data is stored per aggregation level. Disabled by default. |
<!-- /generate-sample-config -->

## Environment variables

Environment variables **MUST** have `PYROSCOPE_` prefix and be in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` format, for example:
```shell
PYROSCOPE_API_BIND_ADDR=:9999 pyroscope server
```

## Configuration file

Config files are stored in [YAML format](https://yaml.org/start.html). The default configuration file path is located at:

* `/etc/pyroscope/server.yml` on Linux
* `/usr/local/etc/pyroscope/server.yml` on Intel macOS
* `/opt/homebrew/etc/pyroscope/server.yml` on M1 macOS

You can override the location with `-config <path>` argument, for example:

```shell
pyroscope server -config my-custom-config.yml
```

Or an environment variable:

```
PYROSCOPE_CONFIG=/tmp/pyroscope-server.yml pyroscope server
```

## Authentication
See the [server authentication](auth-google.mdx) page for more details on how to add authentication to your Pyroscope server.

## Data retention
See the [data retention](retention.mdx) page for more details on how to configure retention policies.

## Metrics export rules
See the [metrics export](metrics-export.mdx) page for more details on how to export profiling data as Prometheus metrics.

## Scraping
See the [pull mode](integration-golang-pull-mode.mdx) page for more details on how to configure remote targets scraping.
