This document describe the steps one would need to take to create a new integration, meaning a new language or a platform.

## Integrations

There are two ways to integrate with pyroscope:
* The fastest way to integrate with pyroscope is by using the [HTTP API](server-api-reference.mdx). You can start pushing data into pyroscope with
just a few lines of code. Downside of this approach is that you'll have to manage certain things like sampling rate and
upload rate yourself.

* Alternatively, a new `spy` may be developed: this one is for you if your profiler comes as an executable or a C library
that profiles other processes. This type of integration is more complex but comes with an advantage of not having to
worry about sampling rates or error handling or uploading the data. In this case, the spy becomes part of
**Pyroscope Agent**.
