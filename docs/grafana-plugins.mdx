Grafana plugins allow to add pyroscope flamegraph to your Grafana dashboard.

There is now a native Flamegraph visualization in Grafana and the [Phlare datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/datasources/grafana-pyroscope/)
has been updated to work with both Pyroscope as a backend. 

Please see the [Phlare datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/datasources/grafana-pyroscope/) documentation for more information on how to add
Pyroscope profiles to your Grafana instance.
