Pyroscope uses [phpspy](https://github.com/adsr/phpspy) to collect profiling data.

#### Supported platforms

###  Profiling PHP application

To start profiling a PHP application, add `pyroscope exec` before the command:

```shell
export PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.php.app
export PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://pyroscope-server:4040

pyroscope exec php main.php
```

You can also attach pyroscope to already running process using `pyroscope connect`:

```shell
pyroscope connect --pid {my-app-pid}
```

Refer to [Configuration](/docs/agent-configuration-overview) page to learn more about **Pyroscop Agent** and how to configure it.

To start profiling a PHP application in a container, you may wrap your application with `pyroscope exec` as an
entrypoint of your image. The tricky part is that you need to copy pyroscope binary to your docker container.
To do that, use `COPY --from` command in your Dockerfile.

The following example Dockerfile shows how to build the image:
```shell
FROM php:7.3.27

WORKDIR /var/www/html

# this copies pyroscope binary from pyroscope image to your image:
COPY --from=pyroscope/pyroscope:latest /usr/bin/pyroscope /usr/bin/pyroscope
COPY main.php ./main.php

# optionally you may set the pyroscope server address as well as the app name, make sure you change these:
ENV PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.php.app
ENV PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://pyroscope:4040/

# this starts your app with pyroscope profiler, make sure to change "php" and "main.php" to the actual command.
CMD ["pyroscope", "exec", "php", "main.php"]
```

If you are using Docker Compose, you can run both pyroscope server and agent with this configuration:

```yaml
---
services:
  pyroscope-server:
    image: "pyroscope/pyroscope:latest"
    ports:
      - "4040:4040"
    command:
      - "server"
  app:
    image: "my-app:latest"
    env:
      PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS: http://pyroscope-server:4040
      PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME: my.php.app
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```

:::tip **Important!**
When running `pyroscope exec` inside a Docker container, make sure to add `--cap-add=sys_ptrace` to your `docker run` command. You can read more about this [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/04/29/why-strace-doesnt-work-in-docker/).

In docker-compose you'll need to add the following code:
```
cap_add:
  - SYS_PTRACE
```
