### What are the minimum system requirements for running pyroscope? (RAM, Memory, CPU)
* RAM (2GB ~ 4GB). See [My pyroscope server runs out of memory](#my-pyroscope-server-runs-out-of-memory) for more details.
* CPU ???
* Disk ???

### My pyroscope server runs out of memory
It's difficult to accurately estimate memory consumption in advance, as it is highly dependent on the workload - mainly the size of profiles and the ingestion rate.

It's fair to estimate resource consumption per agent/target based on the actual memory consumption under the actual load. As a pessimistic estimation we suggest 32 MB per agent/target.


Also keep in mind pyroscope reserves some memory at startup (~400 MB), and also makes heavy use of various internal caches that grow over time and affect overall memory consumption. There are 2 parameters to manage this:
* `cache-evict-threshold`: percentage of consumed memory at which cache evictions start. The parameter relies on the container limits.
* `cache-evict-volume`: percentage of cache that is evicted per eviction run.

### My pyroscope server is running out of space
In these cases, you can set up a more aggressive retention policy. See the [Data retention page](/docs/data-retention) for more instructions

### My pyroscope server is crashing due to out of space
Although pyroscope tries to leave enough space, it may be possible that it gets stuck in a crashing state, where it can't even start due to lack of space.

There are 2 options: increase the disk and free some data.

#### Free some data
:::warning
We don't guarantee pyroscope will be able to deal with this correctly. Only use this as a last resort. Preferrably do a backup first. 
:::

It depends on where you are running, for kubernetes you can overwrite the Deployment's [`args` to run a dummy command](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/helm-chart/blob/bfe876922f6970dc8ccf38c558957de76ce746eb/chart/pyroscope/templates/deployment.yaml#L32-L35) (like `sleep infinity`).

Then, you can the oldest `.vlog` files in the `trees` directory.
