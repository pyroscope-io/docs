## OpenTelemetry support

Pyroscope can integrate with distributed tracing systems supporting [**OpenTelemetry**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/ruby/getting-started/) standard which allows you to
link traces with the profiling data, and find specific lines of code related to a performance issue.

:::note
 * Because of how sampling profilers work, spans shorter than the sample interval may not be captured. By default pyroscope CPU profiler probes stack traces 100 times per second, meaning that spans shorter than 10ms may not be captured.
:::

Ruby code can be easily instrumented with [otel-profiling-ruby package](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/otel-profiling-ruby/) package -
a `Pyroscope::Otel::SpanProcessor` implementation, that annotates profiling data with span IDs which makes it possible to filter
out profile of a particular trace span in Pyroscope.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pyroscope-otel'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pyroscope-otel

## Usage
Configure [pyroscope](/docs/ruby) and then configure OpenTelemetry with `Pyroscope::Otel::SpanProcessor`
```ruby
Pyroscope.configure do |config|
  # Configure pyroscope as described https://pyroscope.io/docs/ruby/
end

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |config|
  config.add_span_processor Pyroscope::Otel::SpanProcessor.new(
    "#{app_name}.cpu", # your app name with ".cpu" suffix, for example rideshare-ruby.cpu
    pyroscope_endpoint # link to your pyroscope server, for example "http://localhost:4040"
  )
  # Configure the rest of opentelemetry as described  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby
end
```


## Configuration options

You can control some processor options with the following flags:

```ruby
Pyroscope::Otel::SpanProcessor.new("#{app_name}.cpu", pyroscope_endpoint).tap do |proc|
    # boolean flag option to annotate spans with profile attributes only on root spans.
    proc.root_span_only = true
    # boolean flag option to annotate pyroscope profiles with parent name
    proc.add_span_name = true
    # boolean flag option to add profiler url to parent attributes
    proc.add_url = true
  end
```
## Profiles

Collected profiles can be viewed in Pyroscope UI using FlameQL:
- `simple.ruby.cpu{profile_id="<spanID>"}` - Shows flamegraph for a particular span.
- `simple.ruby.cpu{span_name="ExampleSpan"}` - Shows aggregated profile for all spans named **ExampleSpan**.

For convenience, the tracer annotates profiled spans with extra attributes:
- `pyroscope.profile.id` - is set to span ID to indicate that profile was captured for a span.
- `pyroscope.profile.url` - contains the URL to the flamegraph in Pyroscope UI.
