:::note
Admin server is in early development stage and should be considered as a Feature Preview.

This functionality is available starting from version 0.3.1 under the `enableExperimentalAdmin` flag. 
:::

:::warning
The `enableExperimentalAdmin` flag will be **removed** in future releases. Use it at your own risk.
:::

Pyroscope has an admin server for certain administration tasks. It uses HTTP over [unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket).
Which means:
* that you **MUST** have file system access to that socket (ie. access over the netork should not be possible)
* that you can interact either via our the `pyroscope admin` command or via the API directly.


## Interacting via the CLI
The CLI has an `admin` subcommand that allows you to interact with the admin server. It even has autocomplete!

From the same machine that's running the server, run:

```shell
pyroscope admin app get
```

## Interacting via the API directly
Although this is not the preferred method, it's still possible to do it. All you need is a HTTP client that can do HTTP over unix domain sockets. We recommend using curl, which supports it [since version 7.40](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2015/01/08/curl-7-40-0-unix-domain-sockets-and-smb/).

From the same machine that's running the server, run:
```shell
curl --unix-socket /tmp/pyroscope.sock http://pyroscope/v1/apps
```

[See the complete API reference](#api-reference)

## Troubleshooting
### Failed to contact the admin socket server
That happens when the admin server is not up. Check if you have its flag enabled.

By default, the admin server will create a socket to `/tmp/pyroscope.sock`.

Also keep in mind that the regular file system permission apply, so you should use either the **same user** that run the `pyroscope server` or `root`.

### Can't start the server
When starting a new instance, the cli checks if the socket exists, and if so, try to ping it.

If the socket responds, it means there's already a server running. In that case you can either stop that other instance or create the socket in a different path (`--admin-socket-path`).

If the socket exists but it's not responding, we try to take over. If it's still not possible, try to remove that socket manually.
