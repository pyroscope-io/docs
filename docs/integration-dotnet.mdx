**.NET** is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

**Pyroscope Agent** uses [Diagnostic IPC Protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/main/documentation/design-docs/ipc-protocol.md)
client to communicate to .NET runtime and gather trace events. It is important to note that only managed code is accounted. Refer to [dotnetdiag](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/dotnetdiag) package for implementation details.

#### Supported .NET versions:
 - .NET 6.0
 - .NET 5.0
 - .NET Core 3.1

### Running .NET profiler

  ]}>

#### Interactively

To start profiling a .NET application, add `pyroscope exec` before the command. Run in PowerShell:

```shell
$env:PYROSCOPE_SPY_NAME="dotnetspy";
$env:PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME="my.dotnet.app";
$env:PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS="http://pyroscope-server:4040";

pyroscope exec dotnet myapp.dll
```

Or, if your application is an executable file:

```shell
pyroscope exec myapp.exe "arg1" "arg2"
```

You can also attach pyroscope to already running process using `pyroscope connect`:

```shell
pyroscope connect -pid {my-app-pid}
```

#### Windows Service

On Windows, **Pyroscope Agent** runs as a Windows service (with [`pyroscope agent`](agent-configuration-agent.mdx) command). Therefore if you are going
to continuously profile Windows services, you may find it handy to pre-define `targets` in the configuration file
(by default, the configuration file path is `C:\Program Files\Pyroscope\Pyroscope Agent\agent.yml`):

```yaml
---
log-level: "info"
server-address: http://pyroscope-server:4040
targets:
 - application-name: my.dotnet.svc
   spy-name: dotnetspy
   service-name: MyService
```

After the pyroscope configuration is changed, pyroscope service should be restarted for changes to take effect.
Run in PowerShell **as Administrator**:

```shell
Get-Service pyroscope | Restart-Service
```

Refer to [Configuration](/docs/agent-configuration-overview) page to learn more about **Pyroscop Agent** and how to configure it.

To start profiling a .NET application, add `pyroscope exec` before the command:

```shell
export PYROSCOPE_SPY_NAME=dotnetspy
export PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.dotnet.app
export PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://pyroscope-server:4040

pyroscope exec dotnet myapp.dll
```

Or, if your application is an executable file:
```shell
pyroscope exec myapp arg1 arg2
```

You can also attach pyroscope to already running process using `pyroscope connect`:

```shell
pyroscope connect -pid {my-app-pid}
```

  <TabItem value="docker">

To start profiling a .NET application inside a container, you may wrap your application with `pyroscope exec` as an
entrypoint of your image. The tricky part is that you need to copy pyroscope binary to your docker container.
To do that, use `COPY --from` command in your Dockerfile.

The following example Dockerfile shows how to build the image:
```shell
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0

WORKDIR /dotnet

COPY --from=pyroscope/pyroscope:latest /usr/bin/pyroscope /usr/bin/pyroscope
ADD my-app .
RUN dotnet publish -o . -r $(dotnet --info | grep RID | cut -b 6- | tr -d ' ')

# optionally you may set the pyroscope server address as well as the app name and other configuration options.
ENV PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://pyroscope-server:4040
ENV PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.dotnet.app
ENV PYROSCOPE_LOG_LEVEL=debug

CMD ["pyroscope", "exec", "dotnet", "/dotnet/my-app.dll"]
```

If you are using Docker Compose, you can run both pyroscope server and agent with this configuration:

```yaml
---
version: "3.9"
services:
  pyroscope-server:
    image: "pyroscope/pyroscope:latest"
    ports:
      - "4040:4040"
    command:
      - "server"
  app:
    image: "my-app:latest"
    environment:
      PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME: my.dotnet.app
      PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS: http://pyroscope-server:4040
      PYROSCOPE_LOG_LEVEL: debug
      ASPNETCORE_URLS: http://*:5000
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```
