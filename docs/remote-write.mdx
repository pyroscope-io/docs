This functionality is available starting from [pyroscope version 0.19.0](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/releases/tag/v0.19.0).

Make sure to upgrade before you use this.

## What is Remote Write?
Remote Write is a feature that allows writing data to a remote Pyroscope instance (ie. not the same one that is immediately ingesting the data).

## How does it work?
<!-- TODO: create a diagram? -->

Its current implementation is simple: for all ingested data, the same data is sent to the remote targets' `/ingest` endpoint, concurrently.

:::note
We currently do not provide any guarantees this data is going to be delivered (think for example, network failures). Although in future versions we may implement retries.
:::

## Basic Example
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    bar:
      address: http://bar:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: bar
    baz:
      address: http://baz:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: baz
```

For every ingested profile, it will also write to 2 pyroscope instances: `http://bar:4040` and `http://baz:4040`.
[Tags](https://pyroscope.io/blog/profiling-go-apps-with-pyroscope/#narrowing-in-on-the-issue-using-tags) can (and should) be added, so that you can identify where the profiling data is coming from.

## What are the use cases?
There are mainly 2 use cases:

### Case 1: Aggregating Pyroscope data from multiple remote targets
Consider the following situation in an organization:
* Multiple Kubernetes clusters are [running pull mode](https://pyroscope.io/docs/golang-pull-mode/), ie. Pyroscope scrapes apps (ie. Pyroscope scrapes apps)
* A central pyroscope instance stores data in one place which aggregates profiling data from all of these apps

Pyroscope's `remote-write` option enables collecting data on the _centralized_ Pyroscope instance and only exposing this one instance while allowing the various internal Pyroscope instances remain private.

### Case 2: Migrating to Pyroscope Cloud
For users who are running Pyroscope's Open Source version and would like to migrate to Pyroscope's Cloud version, _before_ `remote-write` it required:

1. Updating applications to point to Pyroscope Cloud
2. Replacing API Keys
3. Redeploying applications

:::


With remote write, migrating to the cloud is simple as adding the Pyroscope Cloud instance as a target (and as you transition your open source data will be unaffected)! For example:
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  disable-local-writes: true
  targets:
    pyroscope-cloud:
      address: https://ingest.pyroscope.cloud
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        # optional tag to distinguish between different clusters you have
        cluster-name: my-cluster
```
## Disabling local writes
The `disable-local-writes` configuration allows disabling writes to the local storage.
We recommend using this option if you only want to relay data to another pyroscope instance and don't need to write it locally.

Keep in mind, in some situations it may be useful to leave local writes enabled, so that if a remote target is having issues, it's still possible to access the ingested data locally.

```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  disable-local-writes: true
```
## Tuning

 We recommend using the following [defaults](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/12cf3a975215b9cb8b5c14d75b89437140c79284/pkg/remotewrite/concurrency.go#L9), however, not every environment is the same. If you have trouble configuring these values please, create an [issue](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/issues) reach out to support@pyroscope.io or join our [slack channel](https://pyroscope.io/slack) and we'd love to help. 
 
 That being said, Pyroscope has a few key configurable options:


```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    bar:
      address: http://bar:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: bar

      # tweakable
      timeout: 1m
      queue-size: 100
      queue-workers: 4
```


| Field | Description | Default Value |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `timeout`   | Maximum amount of time each upload can take. It uses the standard [Go time duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). | `10s` |
| `queue-size`       | Maximum amount of items that can be stored in the queue at a time. | `100` |
| `queue-workers`       | How many queue workers are running. | `max(numCPU * 4, 64)` |


### Metrics
Prometheus metrics are also exposed:


| Metric | Type | Description  |
|--------|-------|---|
| `pyroscope_remote_write_client_response_time`   | histogram     |   |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_client_sent_bytes`       | counter      | The total number of bytes of data (not metadata) sent to the remote target.  |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_capacity`       | gauge      | How many items the queue can hold. |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_dropped` | counter      | How many items were dropped (as in not accepted into the queue). |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_workers_total` | gauge | Total number of queue workers. |


Also notice that the key in the yaml is used as `targetName` in the metric. For example, given the following configuration:
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    my-cluster:
      address: http://bar:4040
```

It will create metrics with the following labels (`target_name/target_address`):
```
pyroscope_remote_write_queue_pending{target_address="http://bar:4040",target_name="my-cluster"} 0
```

### Other Considerations
* Enabling remote write will increase bandwith usage, since every ingestion is replicated to the number of targets.
