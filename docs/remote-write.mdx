## What is Remote Write?
Remote Write is a feature that allows writing data to a remote Pyroscope instance (ie. not the same one that is immediately ingesting the data).

## How does it work?
<!-- TODO: create a diagram? -->

Its current implementation is simple: for all ingested data, the same data is sent to the remote targets' `/ingest` endpoint, concurrently.

:::note
We currently do not provide any guarantees this data is going to be delivered (think for example, network failures). Although in future versions we may implement retries.
:::

## Basic Example
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    bar:
      address: http://bar:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: bar
    baz:
      address: http://baz:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: baz
```

For every single ingested profile, it will also write to 2 pyroscope instances: `http://bar:4040` and `http://baz:4040`.
[Tags](https://pyroscope.io/blog/profiling-go-apps-with-pyroscope/#narrowing-in-on-the-issue-using-tags) can (and should) be added, so that you can identify where the profiling data is coming from.

## What are the use cases?
There are mainly 2 use cases:

### Case 1: Running Pyroscope at the "edge"
Consider the following situation in an organization:
* multiple Kubernetes clusters
* [running pull mode](https://pyroscope.io/docs/golang-pull-mode/), ie. Pyroscope scrapes apps
* a central Pyroscope instance that these other remote pyroscope instances write to

That enables not exposing these internal Pyroscope instances, since they only scrape data. Therefore the only exposed instance is the central one.

### Case 2: migrating to Pyroscope Cloud
Consider a user that is running Pyroscope Open Source, and wants to experiment with the [Pyroscope Cloud version](https://pyroscope.cloud) (or any other implementation of the `/ingest` endpoint, as for example a Pyroscope Canary instance).

It requires updating all apps to point to Pyroscope Cloud, regenerating all API Keys, redeploying all apps, etc. Which is cumbersome.

With remote write one only needs to add the Pyroscope Cloud instance as a target. For example:
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  disable-local-writes: true
  targets:
    pyroscope-cloud:
      address: https://ingest.pyroscope.cloud
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        # optional tag to distinguish between different clusters you have
        cluster-name: my-cluster
```
## Disabling local writes
The `disable-local-writes` configuration allows disabling writes to the local storage.
It's useful if you need just to relay data to another pyroscope instance.

Keep in mind it may be useful to leave local writes enabled, so that if the remote target is having issues, it's still possible to access the ingested data.

```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  disable-local-writes: true
```
## Tuning

Although we try to provide [smart defaults](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/12cf3a975215b9cb8b5c14d75b89437140c79284/pkg/remotewrite/concurrency.go#L9), not every environment is the same. Therefore we also allow a few configurable points:


```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    bar:
      address: http://bar:4040
      auth-token: MY_AUTH_TOKEN
      tags:
        foo: bar

      # tweakable
      timeout: 1m
      queue-size: 100
      queue-workers: 4
```

The fields should be self-explanatory, but for completeness they are:

| Field | Description | Default Value |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `timeout`   | Maximum amount of time each upload can take. It uses the standard [Go time duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). | `10s` |
| `queue-size`       | Maximum amount of items that can be stored in the queue at a time. | `100` |
| `queue-workers`       | How many queue workers are running. | `max(numCPU * 4, 64)` |


### Metrics
Prometheus metrics are also exposed:


| Metric | Type | Description  |
|--------|-------|---|
| `pyroscope_remote_write_client_response_time`   | histogram     |   |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_client_sent_bytes`       | counter      | The total number of bytes of data (not metadata) sent to the remote target.  |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_capacity`       | gauge      | How many items the queue can hold. |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_dropped` | counter      | How many items were dropped (as in not accepted into the queue). |
| `pyroscope_remote_write_queue_workers_total` | gauge | Total number of queue workers. |


Also notice that the key in the yaml is used as `targetName` in the metric. For example, given the following configuration:
```yaml
remote-write:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    my-cluster:
      address: http://bar:4040
```

It will create metrics with the following labels (`target_name/target_address`):
```
pyroscope_remote_write_queue_pending{target_address="http://bar:4040",target_name="my-cluster"} 0
```

### Other Considerations
* Enabling remote write will increase bandwith usage, since every ingestion is replicated to the number of targets.
