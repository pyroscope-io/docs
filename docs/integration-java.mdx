Pyroscope uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) to collect profiling data from Java applications.

#### Supported platforms

| Linux | macOS | Windows | Docker |

### Installation

Java integration is distributed as a single jar file: `pyroscope.jar`. It contains native `async-profiler` libraries for:

* Linux on x64;
* Linux on ARM64;
* MacOS on x64.
* MacOS on ARM64.

Visit our GitHub [releases](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-java/releases) page to download the latest version of `pyroscope.jar`.


### Profiling Java application

To start profiling a Java application, run your application with `pyroscope.jar` javaagent:

```shell
export PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.java.app
export PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://pyroscope-server:4040

# Optionally, if authentication is enabled, specify the API key.
# export PYROSCOPE_AUTH_TOKEN={YOUR_API_KEY}

java -javaagent:pyroscope.jar -jar app.jar
```

Starting with v0.5.0, Java integration supports JFR format to be able to support multiple events (JFR is the only output format that supports [multiple events in `async-profiler`](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler#multiple-events)). There are several environment variables that define how multiple event configuration works:

* `PYROSCOPE_FORMAT` sets the profiler output format. The default is `collapsed`, but in order to support multiple formats it must be set to `jfr`.
* `PYROSCOPE_PROFILER_EVENT` sets the profiler event. With JFR format enabled, this event refers to one of the possible CPU profiling events: `itimer`, `cpu`, `wall`. The default is `itimer`.
* `PYROSCOPE_PROFILER_ALLOC` sets the allocation threshold to register the events, in bytes (equivalent to `--alloc=` in `async-profiler`). The default value is "" - empty string, which means that allocation profiling is disabled. Setting it to `0` will register all the events.
* `PYROSCOPE_PROFILER_LOCK` sets the lock threshold to register the events, in nanoseconds (equivalent to `--lock=` in `async-profiler`). The default value is "" - empty string, which means that lock profiling is disabled. Setting it to `0` will register all the events.

### Labels

It is possible to add dynamic tags (labels) to the profiling data. These tags can be used to filter the data in the UI.

Add pyroscope dependency to your `build.gradle`:
```kotlin
implementation("io.pyroscope:agent:${pyroscope_version}")
```
Add labels dynamically:
```java
import io.pyroscope.labels.LabelsSet;
import io.pyroscope.labels.Pyroscope;

Pyroscope.LabelsWrapper.run(new LabelsSet("controller", "slow_controller"), () -> {
    slowCode();
});
```

It is also possible to possible to add static tags (labels) to the profiling data:

```java
import io.pyroscope.labels.Pyroscope;

Pyroscope.setStaticLabels(Map.of("REGION", System.getenv("REGION")));
```
