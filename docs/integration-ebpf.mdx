eBPF is an emerging Linux kernel technology that allows for user-supplied programs to run inside of the kernel. This enables a bunch of interesting use cases, particularly efficient CPU profiling of the whole Linux system.

#### Supported platforms

| Spy Name     | Type         | Linux | macOS | Windows | Docker |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:------:|
| ebpfspy      | `embedded`   |   ✅  |       |         |   ✅   |

### Benefits of using eBPF for continuous profiling
The pros of using the eBPF integration are:
* Easy installation: You can add the agent to your node without making code changes as opposed to adding agent libraries to your code
* Access to kernel stacktraces: While most agent libraries focus on user-space code performance, eBPF can also give insight into kernel-space code performance

### Tradeoffs of using eBPF for continuous profiling
Because eBPF is still a growing technology, there's a few tradeoffs that you have to make in order use eBPF for profiling your applications
* Doesn't work as well with interpreted languages
* Requires certain kernel versions




### Getting Started with eBPF Profiling
For the reasons mentioned above, we recommend an hybrid approach for better results: eBPF to profile the node and specific language instrumentation per application. The following steps will explain how to get started:

#### Prerequisites for profiling with eBPF

For the eBPF integration to work you'll need:
* A [pyroscope server](https://pyroscope.io/docs/installing-pyroscope-overview/#step-1-install-pyroscope-server) where the agent will send profiling data
* A Linux machine with the kernel version >= 4.9 (due to [BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT](https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/1/831)).

### Running eBPF profiler on Kubernetes

#### Step 1. Install pyroscope agent

First, add the helm repo
```shell
helm repo add pyroscope-io https://pyroscope-io.github.io/helm-chart
```

Then install the agent
```shell
helm install pyroscope-ebpf pyroscope-io/pyroscope-ebpf
```

It will install pyroscope eBPF agent on all of your nodes and start profiling applications across your cluster.

:::note
If you're using [Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/), you can specify an auth key by populating the `PYROSCOPE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable or passing an `--auth-token` flag:
```
- "--auth-token"
- "PYROSCOPE_CLOUD_API_KEY"
- "--server-address"
- "https://ingest.pyroscope.cloud"
```
:::

### Running eBPF profiler from binary

```shell
export PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.ebpf.program
export PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://address-of-pyroscope-server:4040/
export PYROSCOPE_SPY_NAME=ebpfspy
# optionally, if authentication is enabled, specify the API key:
# export PYROSCOPE_AUTH_TOKEN={YOUR_API_KEY}

# to wrap an existing program and profile it
sudo -E pyroscope exec mongod

# to profile the whole system
sudo -E pyroscope ebpf
```

### Dealing with [unknowns]

eBPF relies on having debugging symbols available for each program installed in your system. If you don't have those you'll see a lot of stacktraces full of `[unknown]`s. On most systems you can get debugging symbols for most packages with `debuginfo-install` command:

```shell
sudo debuginfo-install -y <pkg>
```

### Configuration

All parameters below are also supported as CLI arguments, a full list can be accessed via `pyroscope ebpf --help`. For brevity only environment variables are listed.

* `PYROSCOPE_KUBERNETES_NODE` Set to current k8s Node.nodeName for service discovery and labeling
* `PYROSCOPE_ONLY_SERVICES` Ignore processes unknown to service discovery
* `PYROSCOPE_SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE` Max size of symbols cache (1 entry per process)

| env var                    | default                          | description                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `PYROSCOPE_KUBERNETES_NODE` | `""` | Used by service discovery. It's automatically set in the Helm Chart. |
| `PYROSCOPE_ONLY_SERVICES`     | `false`                             | Ignore processes unknown to service discovery. In a Kubernetes cluster it ignores processes like `containerd, runc, kubelet` etc | 
| `PYROSCOPE_SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE` | `256`                          | Max size of symbols cache (1 entry per process). Change this value if you’re experiencing memory pressure or have many individual services. |
