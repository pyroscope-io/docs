eBPF is an emerging Linux kernel technology that allows for user-supplied programs to run inside of the kernel. This enables a bunch of interesting usecases, particularly efficient CPU profiling of the whole Linux system.

#### Supported platforms

| Spy Name     | Type         | Linux | macOS | Windows | Docker |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:------:|
| ebpfspy      | `embedded`   |   ✅  |       |         |   ✅   |

### Prerequisites

For this to work you'll need
* a Linux machine with the kernel version >= 4.9.
* BCC tools installed on the system you want to profile. Visit [BCC documentation](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#packages) to find the best way of installing it on your system. There are prebuilt binaries available for most flavors of Linux.
* pyroscope server and agent. Visit our [Getting Started guide](/docs/#step-1-install-the-pyroscope-server) to learn about that.

### Running eBPF profiler

<Tabs
  defaultValue="kubernetes"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes', value: 'kubernetes'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
export PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.ebpf.program
export PYROSCOPE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://address-of-pyroscope-server:4040/
export PYROSCOPE_SPY_NAME=ebpfspy

# to wrap an existing program and profile it
sudo -E pyroscope exec mongod

# to profile the whole system, pass -1 as pid
sudo -E pyroscope connect -pid -1
```

### Dealing with [unknowns]

eBPF relies on having debugging symbols available for each program installed in your system. If you don't have those you'll see a lot of stacktraces full of `[unknown]`s. On most systems you can get debugging symbols for most packages with `debuginfo-install` command:

```shell
sudo debuginfo-install -y <pkg>
```

### Example

Check out this [docker-compose example in our repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/examples/ebpf) for an example of how you can use eBPF integration.

#### Step 1. Install pyroscope server

This will provision a pyroscope server in your cluster in `pyroscope` namespace.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://pyroscope.io/k8s/pyroscope-server.yaml
```

#### Step 2. Install pyroscope agent

This will install pyroscope eBPF agent on all of your nodes and start profiling applications across your cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://pyroscope.io/k8s/pyroscope-agent.yaml
```

### Future of our eBPF integration

One thing we're excited about at Pyroscope is eBPF portability efforts, particularly introduction of BTF (BPF Type Format) technology. You can read more about that [here](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html). When kernels with BTF support become more mainstream we're gonna embed libbpf directly into our go binary.
