This guide will help you add Pyroscope to Kubernetes using Helm.


## Getting started with Helm
To install the pyroscope we are going to use the [helm chart](https://pyroscope-io.github.io/helm-chart).
[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the chart. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

## Add the Pyroscope Helm repository
```
helm repo add pyroscope-io https://pyroscope-io.github.io/helm-chart
```

## Install Pyrocope
```
helm install pyroscope pyroscope-io/pyroscope 
```

## Verify that Pyroscope is running in your environment:
```
kubectl get pods
```

## Recommendations
Check the [Troubleshooting/FAQ page](/docs/troubleshooting-faq) for recommendations on how to run pyroscope in production.
