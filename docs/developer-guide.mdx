This guide will help you get started developing Pyroscope.

Pyroscope consists of 2 core components:
* webapp, mostly JS code, UI for the web application
* go code, this is all the backend code including profiling code and the storage engine.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before setting up your developer environment:

* git
* go
* node + yarn
* rust (*optional, you'll only need it to work on Python and Ruby integrations*)
* php (*optional, you'll only need it to work on PHP integration*)

### Installing dependencies on macOS

On macOS we recommend you to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage dependencies:

```shell
brew install git
brew install go
brew install node
brew install rust # optional
brew install php  # optional

npm install -g yarn
```

## Building pyroscope locally

To start developing you need to know a few commands:


#### 1. Clone the repo:
```shell
git@github.com:pyroscope-io/pyroscope.git
```

#### 2. Install go developer tools:

These are required to build the go code.

```shell
make install-dev-tools
```

#### 3. Build third-party dependencies (optional):

:::note
This step is optional, you can skip it if you don't need to work on Python, Ruby or PHP integrations.
:::

```shell
# if this command doesn't succeed consider skipping this step (see comment above)
make build-third-party-dependencies
```


#### 4. Build web assets (JavaScript + SCSS code):
```shell
make assets
# to build assets in --watch mode use this command:
make assets-watch
```

#### 5. Builds the main binary, puts it in `bin/pyroscope`:
```shell
make build
```

:::caution
if this command fails try building the binary without third party integrations:
```
ENABLED_SPIES=none make build
```
:::

#### 6. Starts pyroscope server:
```shell
make server
```

---

:::tip
If you're going to be working on pyroscope a lot, consider using this command. It builds assets in watch mode + builds the main binary and starts the server all on one command:
```shell
make dev
```

### VS Code

#### Go

If you're using VS Code we would recommend the official [Go extension from Google](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).

We use `revive` for linting. Add `--config=${workspaceFolder}/revive.toml` to `Go: Lint Flags` section in VS Code settings.

To make sure VS Code adds new lines, set `files.insertFinalNewline` to `true`. See [this stack overflow answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file) for context on why this is important.

## Style Guides

Please checkout out the [style guides](/docs/style-guide) we use.

## Logging

We use [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library for logging purposes. There are two rules we follow when it comes to logging:

* `pkg/agent/profiler` should not depend on `logrus`. This is because we don't want our users' logs to be tainted with pyroscope messages.
* Be mindful of log levels. Only log information that would *truly be useful to an average end user* in log levels `Info` or higher. When in doubt, lean on the side of moving log messages to `Debug` level.

## Code Map

### `Makefile`

Used as a collection of shortcuts, e.g `make build` or `make server`

### `examples`

`docker-compose` examples for integrations with different languages.

### `pkg`

Main place for the go code. We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go. See [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) for more information on various style guides we use.

### `pkg/agent`

Code that does the actual profiling.

### `pkg/exec`

Code for `pyroscope exec`. Mostly code related to command line interface.

### `pkg/server`

Server related code, mostly HTTP controllers.

### `pkg/storage`

Storage code. Heavy on various tree-like data structures, low level database things.

### `cmd/pyroscope`

Place for command line interface initialization code.

### `tools`

Place where we define the developer dependencies for go code. Kind of like `devDependencies`, but for Go.

### `webapp`

This is where the webapp lives.

### `scripts`

Location for various helper programs / scripts.

### `scripts/packages`

Helper code / files we use to make releases and generate packages for Linux / macOS. See [Downloads](/downloads) page for more information.

### `third_party/rustdeps`

Pyroscope depends on a few rust projects, particularly `rbspy` and `py-spy`.
