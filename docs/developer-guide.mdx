This guide will help you get started developing Pyroscope.

Pyroscope consists of 2 core components:
* webapp, mostly JS code, UI for the web application
* go code, this is all the backend code including profiling code and the storage engine.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before setting up your developer environment:

* git
* go
* node + yarn
* rust (*optional, you'll only need it to work on Python and Ruby integrations*)
* php (*optional, you'll only need it to work on PHP integration*)

### Installing dependencies

<Tabs

  values={[
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Debian', value: 'debian'},
    {label: 'CentOS/RHEL', value: 'centos'},
    {label: 'Fedora', value: 'fedora'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="macos">
    On macOS we recommend you to use <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to manage dependencies:
    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">
    {
      "brew install git\n" +
      "brew install go\n" +
      "brew install node\n" +
      "brew install rust # optional\n" +
      "brew install php  # optional\n\n" +
      "npm install -g yarn\n"
    }
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

:::note
These instructions are Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), which default Go version is lower than 1.16.
If you are using a later Ubuntu version the default golang package shoudl work fine.
:::

    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">
    {

      "# Make Go 1.16 the default when running `go'\n\n" +

      "npm install -g yarn"
    }
    </CodeBlock>

  <TabItem value="debian">

:::note
These instructions are Debian 11 "bullseye", which default Go version is lower than 1.16.
Go 1.16 is available through `bullseye-backports` source.
If you are using a later Debian version the default golang package shoudl work fine.

## Building pyroscope locally

To start developing you need to know a few commands:


#### 1. Clone the repo:
```shell
git@github.com:pyroscope-io/pyroscope.git
```

#### 2. Install go developer tools:

These are required to build the go code.

```shell
make install-dev-tools
```

#### 3. Build third-party dependencies (optional):

:::note
This step is optional, you can skip it if you don't need to work on Python, Ruby or PHP integrations.
:::

```shell
# if this command doesn't succeed consider skipping this step (see comment above)
make build-third-party-dependencies
```


#### 4. Build web assets (JavaScript + SCSS code):
```shell
make assets
```

#### 5. Builds the main binary, puts it in `bin/pyroscope`:
```shell
make build
```

:::note
If you have skipped step 3 (build third-party dependencies), you'll need to build the binary without third party integrations:
```
ENABLED_SPIES=none make build
```
:::

#### 6. Starts pyroscope server:
```shell
make server
```

---

## Building pyroscope for local development

If you're going to be working on pyroscope a lot, consider doing the following:

(Only run these commands once)
```shell
make install-dev-tools
make build-third-party-dependencies
make install-web-dependencies
```

Then run
```shell
make dev
```
It builds assets in watch mode + builds the main binary and starts the server all on one command.

## Text Editors

### VS Code

#### Go

If you're using VS Code we would recommend the official [Go extension from Google](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).

We use `revive` for linting. Add `--config=${workspaceFolder}/revive.toml` to `Go: Lint Flags` section in VS Code settings.

To make sure VS Code adds new lines, set `files.insertFinalNewline` to `true`. See [this stack overflow answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file) for context on why this is important.

## Style Guides

Please checkout out the [style guides](/docs/style-guide) we use.

## Logging

We use [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library for logging purposes. There are two rules we follow when it comes to logging:

* `pkg/agent/profiler` should not depend on `logrus`. This is because we don't want our users' logs to be tainted with pyroscope messages.
* Be mindful of log levels. Only log information that would *truly be useful to an average end user* in log levels `Info` or higher. When in doubt, lean on the side of moving log messages to `Debug` level.

## Code Map

### /Makefile

Used as a collection of shortcuts, e.g `make build` or `make server`

### /examples

`docker-compose` examples for integrations with different languages.

### /pkg

Main place for the go code. We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go. See [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) for more information on various style guides we use.

### /pkg/agent

Code that does the actual profiling.

### /pkg/exec

Code for `pyroscope exec`. Mostly code related to command line interface.

### /pkg/server

Server related code, mostly HTTP controllers.

### /pkg/storage

Storage code. Heavy on various tree-like data structures, low level database things.

### /cmd/pyroscope

Place for command line interface initialization code.

### /tools

Place where we define the developer dependencies for go code. Kind of like `devDependencies`, but for Go.

### /webapp

This is where the webapp lives.

### /scripts

Location for various helper programs / scripts.

### /scripts/packages

Helper code / files we use to make releases and generate packages for Linux / macOS. See [Downloads](/downloads) page for more information.

### /third_party/rustdeps

Pyroscope depends on a few rust projects, particularly `rbspy` and `py-spy`.
