This guide will help you get started developing Pyroscope.

Pyroscope consists of 2 core components:
* webapp, mostly JS code, UI for the web application
* go code, this is all the backend code including profiling code and the storage engine.

Both run under the port `4040`.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before setting up your developer environment:

* git
* go
* node + yarn
* rust (*optional, you'll only need it to work on Python and Ruby integrations*)
* php (*optional, you'll only need it to work on PHP integration*)

### Installing dependencies

<Tabs
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Debian', value: 'debian'},
    {label: 'CentOS/RHEL', value: 'centos'},
    {label: 'Fedora', value: 'fedora'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="macos">
    On macOS we recommend you to use <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to manage dependencies:

<CodeBlock className="language-shell">
{
  "brew install git\n" +
  "brew install go\n" +
  "brew install node\n" +
  "brew install rust # optional\n" +
  "brew install php  # optional\n\n" +
  "npm install -g yarn\n"
}
</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

:::note
These instructions are Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), which default Go version is lower than 1.16.
If you are using a later Ubuntu version the default golang package should work fine.
:::


<CodeBlock className="language-shell">
{
  "apt-get install git golang-1.16 make nodejs npm\n" +
  "echo 'export PATH=/usr/lib/go-1.16/bin/:${PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc " +
  "# Make Go 1.16 the default when running `go'\n\n" +
  "apt-get install php-dev rustc # optional\n\n" +
  "npm install -g yarn"
}
</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="debian">

:::note
These instructions are Debian 11 "bullseye", which default Go version is lower than 1.16.
Go 1.16 is available through `bullseye-backports` source.
If you are using a later Debian version the default golang package should work fine.
:::

<CodeBlock className="language-shell">
{
  "# These first two steps can be skipped if bullseye-backports is already a source\n" +
  "echo deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main contrib >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n" +
  "apt-get update\n\n" +
  "apt-get install git golang-1.16 make nodejs npm\n" +
  "echo 'export PATH=/usr/lib/go-1.16/bin/:${PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc" +
  "# Make Go 1.16 the default when running `go'\n\n" +
  "apt-get install libunwind8-dev php-dev rustc # optional\n\n" +
  "npm install -g yarn\n"
}
</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="centos">
    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">
    {
      "yum install git golang make nodejs\n" +
      "yum install php-devel cargo rustc # optional\n\n" +
      "npm install -g yarn\n"
    }
    </CodeBlock>

## Developing pyroscope

#### 1. Clone the repo:
```shell
git@github.com:pyroscope-io/pyroscope.git
```

#### 2. Bootstrap

These are required to build the go code, among other things.

(Only run these commands once)
```shell
make install-dev-tools

# optional step, only run if you need to work on ruby/python/php integrations
make build-third-party-dependencies

make install-web-dependencies
make web-bootstrap
```

#### 3. Run the server

```shell
make dev
```
It builds assets in watch mode + builds the main binary and starts the server all on one command.

:::note
If you have skipped building `third-party dependencies`, you'll need to build the binary without third party integrations:
```
ENABLED_SPIES=none make dev
```
:::

#### 4. Access the server
It should be available at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040)

## Text Editors

### VS Code

#### Go

If you're using VS Code we would recommend the official [Go extension from Google](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).

We use `revive` for linting. Add `--config=${workspaceFolder}/revive.toml` to `Go: Lint Flags` section in VS Code settings.

To make sure VS Code adds new lines to the end of text files, set `files.insertFinalNewline` to `true`. See [this stack overflow answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file) for context on why this is important.

To make sure VS Code removes trailing whitespaces, set `files.trimTrailingWhitespace` to `true`. See [this stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/300489/why-is-it-bad-to-commit-lines-with-trailing-whitespace-into-source-control/300493#300493)

### GoLand

### Debug

If you're using GoLand IDE and want to debug it, you can set GoLand's run/debug configuration as the following:

* Run Kind :`Package`
* Package Path: `{Your Project Path}/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/cmd/pyroscope`
* Program arguments: The sub-module your want to run/debug, such as `server`, you can see all of them wih command `pyroscope --help`


## Style Guides

Please checkout out the [style guides](/docs/style-guide) we use.

## Storyboard / Design Guide for the frontend

When working on the frontend, please refer to our [Storybook](https://pyroscope.io/storybook/) for examples of commonly used elements and examples.

These examples are stored under the `/stories` directory.

## Logging

We use [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library for logging purposes. There are two rules we follow when it comes to logging:

* `pkg/agent/profiler` should not depend on `logrus`. This is because we don't want our users' logs to be tainted with pyroscope messages.
* Be mindful of log levels. Only log information that would *truly be useful to an average end user* in log levels `Info` or higher. When in doubt, lean on the side of moving log messages to `Debug` level.

## Code Map

### /Makefile

Used as a collection of shortcuts, e.g `make build` or `make server`

### /examples

`docker-compose` examples for integrations with different languages.

### /pkg

Main place for the go code. We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go. See [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) for more information on various style guides we use.

### /pkg/agent

Code that does the actual profiling.

### /pkg/exec

Code for `pyroscope exec`. Mostly code related to command line interface.

### /pkg/server

Server related code, mostly HTTP controllers.

### /pkg/storage

Storage code. Heavy on various tree-like data structures, low level database things.

### /cmd/pyroscope

Place for command line interface initialization code.

### /tools

Place where we define the developer dependencies for go code. Kind of like `devDependencies`, but for Go.

### /webapp

This is where the webapp lives.

### /scripts

Location for various helper programs / scripts.

### /scripts/packages

Helper code / files we use to make releases and generate packages for Linux / macOS. See [Downloads](/downloads) page for more information.

### /third_party/rustdeps

Pyroscope depends on a few rust projects, particularly `rbspy` and `py-spy`.

## Troubleshooting
### `goreman: No such file or directory`
Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` in your `PATH`. (`GOPATH` is usually `~/go`)

### `bad file descriptor/too many open files`
If you are getting a `bad file descriptor` or `too many open files` error, then run this command: `ulimit -S -n 2048`. Once you do that, run the `make dev` command again. Please note that the ulimit shell command only works on Unix-like OS (e.g. Linux/macOS).
