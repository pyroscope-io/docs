# Deleting an App

To delete an app, run

```shell
$ pyroscope admin app delete $APP_NAME
```

You will be asked to confirm that app name:
```
> Are you sure you want to delete the app 'myapp'? This action can not be reversed.
> Type 'myapp' to confirm (without quotes).
myapp
> Deleted app 'myapp'.
```

If you prefer to skip that validation, the `--force` flag can be used:

```shell
$ pyroscope admin app delete myapp --force
> Deleted app 'myapp'.
```

By default, a timeout of **30 minutes** is used. You can overwrite that behaviour by passing the `--timeout` flag.

```shell
$ pyroscope admin app delete myapp --force --timeout=10s
> Deleted app 'myapp'.
```

# Warnings
The database will be locked for writes while performing that operation, which means that a lot of profiling data may be dropped depending on how long the command takes to run (although we try to minimize how long it holds the lock).
