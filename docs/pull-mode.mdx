## Push vs Pull

Modern observability systems generally fall into two categories: those where services push data, and those where the
observability system pulls data from services. We find that both approaches are suitable: they both have advantages
and disadvantages, and one of them can be more desirable than another under certain circumstances.

Pyroscope server can operate in both Pull and Push modes. The current implementation makes extensive use of Prometheus
scrape and service discovery mechanisms. We express our deep gratitude to Prometheus team for their incredible work!

:::note
Pyroscope Pull mode is in early development stage and should be considered as a preview feature.

### Supported languages and platforms

Any application that exposes data in [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md) format via HTTP can be set as a remote profiling target.

## Scrape configuration

Pyroscope uses exactly the same mechanisms as Prometheus does in order to ensure smooth user experience. Therefore, it
is configured in almost identical way, and [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
can be used as a reference.

:::note
Pyroscope follows `dash-case` YAML naming convention.
:::

```yaml
scrape-configs:
  # The job name assigned to scraped profiles by default.
  - job-name: pyroscope

    # The list of profiles to be scraped from the targets.
    enabled-profiles: [cpu, mem]

    # Profile presets. Default settings conform to Go pprof profiles.
    # profiles:
    #   cpu:
    #     path: /debug/pprof/profile
    #     params:

    #         cumulative: true

    # How frequently to scrape targets from this job.
    scrape-interval: 10s

    # Per-scrape timeout when scraping this job.
    scrape-timeout: 15s

    # Configures the protocol scheme used for requests.
    scheme: http

    # Sets the `Authorization` header on every scrape request with the
    # configured username and password.
    # password and password-file are mutually exclusive.
    basic_auth: {}

    static-configs: []

    # List of Kubernetes service discovery configurations.

    relabel-configs: []
```

A set of static targets is defined as follows:

```yaml
static-configs:
  - application: my-application-name
    targets:
      - hostname:6060
    labels:
      env: dev
```

:::note
`application` is a mandatory field.

### Profiles configuration

Every job explicitly lists which profiles will be pulled in the `enabled-profiles` directive. Typically, profiles have
distinct URL paths and parameters. Every profile contains samples of one or more types.

Profiles listed in `enabled-profiles` refer to configurations present in `profiles`. Default configuration includes
`cpu` and `mem` profiles that conform Go standard pprof package.

### Service Discovery

At this point, Pyroscope fully supports only [Kubernetes Service Discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config).

## Examples

### Static targets

You can find an example of how Pyroscope scrapes static targets in
[the pyroscope repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/pull/static).

### Kubernetes pods discovery

You can see how Pyroscope discovers remote targets in Kubernetes using
[the example setup](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/pull/kubernetes) in the pyroscope repository.

:::note
Kubernetes Service Discovery requires RBAC set up. Please refer to
[Pyroscope helm chart](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/helm-chart) for details.
