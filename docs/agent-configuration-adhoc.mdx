### `pyroscope adhoc`

This command saves profiling data into files instead of sending it to a server.
It generates these files in two ways:
- Pyroscope stores the profiling data in its native format and data directory
by default. These profiles are then available for analysis using pyroscope UI
(the 'Adhoc Profiling' section), which requires a running pyroscope server.
This output can be disabled with `--no-json-output`.
- Pyroscope also generates profiling data in an external format.
Depending on the number of generated profiles, pyroscope will generate either
a file or a directory, in the directory where pyroscope is run from.
The currently supported formats are standalone HTML (which can then be
shared or directly open in a browser to analyze), pprof or collapsed
(these last two can then be shared and used with either pyroscope UI or other
tooling). The flag `--output-format` is used to specify this format.

pyroscope adhoc is useful for testing programs that are short-lived (scripts, benchmarks, etc.)
and it also makes it easy to share profiling results.

There are multiple ways to gather the profiling data (it supports all the agent modes),
and not all of them are available for all the languages.
The best way to use it depends on several factors: what the language supports,
how the profiled process is launched, and how the profiled process provides the profiled data.

The different supported ways are:
- `exec`. This is the adhoc version of `pyroscope exec`,
  pyroscope creates a different process for the profiled program
  and uses a spy to directly gather profiling data.
  It's a useful way to profile a program that has no other pyroscope integration,
  but it only works for languages where a spy is available.
  It's the default when the spy is provided (using `--spy-name`) or auto detected.
- `connect`. This is the adhoc version of `pyroscope connect`.
  It's similar to `exec`, but it spies an arlaedy running process,
  indicated through `--pid` flag.
- `push`. Pyroscope creates a different process for the profiled program
  and launches an HTTP server with an ingestion endpoint.
  It's useful to profile programs already integrated with Pyroscope using its
  [HTTP API](server-api-reference.mdx#http-api).
  Push mode is used by default when no spy is detected and no `--url` flag is
  provided. It can also be override the default exec mode with the `--push` flag.
- `pull`. This is the adhoc version of pull-mode,
  pyroscope periodically connects to the URL specified thorugh `--url`
  where it tries to retrieve profiling data in any of the supported formats.
  Arguments are optional, and if provided, they are used to launch a new process before polling the URL.
