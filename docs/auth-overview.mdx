:::note
This functionality is available starting from version 0.10.0. Make sure to upgrade before you use this.
:::

Pyroscope server has a built-in user authentication system with support for external providers. By default, user
authentication is disabled.

Internal authentication provider implements login-password authentication mechanism based on JSON Web Tokens using the
internal database. Please see the [internal authentication provider](auth-internal.mdx) page for more details on how to
enable and configure it. The list of external authentication providers includes:
 - [Google OAuth2](auth-google.mdx)
 - [Github OAuth2](auth-github.mdx)
 - [Gitlab OAuth2](auth-gitlab.mdx)

Internal and external providers can be used independently.

When the internal authentication provider is enabled, administrators can also allow users to sign up. On successful
authentication with an external provider, user accounts are created in the internal database automatically, and
administrators are able to manage them. By default, users are granted `ReadOnly` role on sign up, which can be changed
in the server configuration.

Pyroscope Server has a built-in `admin` user with administrative permissions: the account is being created during the
first launch and this can be altered by changing the configuration options. Please refer to the [internal authentication provider](auth-internal.mdx)
documentation.

:::note
Users signed up via OAuth providers are not allowed to use password authentication.
:::

Below you can see available configuration options and their default values.

```yaml
auth:
  # Specifies which role will be granted to a newly signed up user.
  # Supported roles: Admin, ReadOnly. Defaults to ReadOnly.
  # The parameter affects all authentication providers.
  signup-default-role: ReadOnly

  # Specifies SameSite attribute for the JWT token cookie.
  # Supported values: Lax, Strict, None. Default to Lax.
  cookie-same-site: Lax

  # JWT signing string. Generated at provisioning if not specified explicitly.
  jwt-secret: ""

  # Amount of days after which user will be logged out. 0 means non-expiring.
  login-maximum-lifetime-days: 0
```

The options can be also specified via CLI flags or environment variables. See the [server configuration](configuration.mdx)
page for more details on the Pyroscope configuration.

:::note
Pyroscope Server stores user authentication tokens in Cookies. Be default, the cookie is attributed with `SameSite: Lax`
value meaning that it is not sent on normal cross-site subrequests (for example to load images or frames into a third
party site), but is sent when a user is navigating to the origin site (i.e., when following a link). This ensures that
users have reasonably robust defense against some classes of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

You can configure `auth.cookie-same-site` parameter to override this.

Please see **[the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite)** to learn more.
