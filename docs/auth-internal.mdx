Internal authentication provider implements login-password authentication mechanism based on JSON Web Tokens.
User accounts are stored in the internal database and are managed by **Pyroscope Server** administrators.

## Enable Minimal Internal Authentication

The minimal configuration required for enabling internal authentication provider takes the following form:
```yaml
auth:
  internal:
    enabled: true
```

## Login

After enabling the internal authentication provider, Pyroscope Server will prompt you for credentials when you open the UI.
You should be able to log in using the default `admin` username and password (or the values you specified in `auth.internal.admin`):

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

:::caution
We strongly recommend you to change `admin` user password after the first login.

## Configuration Options

The section describes internal authentication provider configuration options.

| Name | Default Value | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| enabled | false | Allow users to authenticate using the login and password. |
| signup-enabled | false | Allow users to create accounts. |
| admin | {} | Built-in admin user. |

By default, users are not allowed to sign up, and administrators should create user accounts on demand, or allow users
to authenticate using external providers.

You can override this behaviour using `auth.internal.signup-enabled` and `auth.signup-default-role` options:

```yaml
auth:
  # Specifies which role will be granted to a newly signed up user.
  # Supported roles: Admin, ReadOnly. Defaults to ReadOnly.
  # The parameter affects all authentication providers.
  signup-default-role: ReadOnly
  # Internal authentication provider configuration.
  internal:
    enabled: true
    signup-enabled: true
```

The options can be also specified via CLI flags or environment variables. See the [server configuration](configuration.mdx)
page for more details on the Pyroscope configuration.

You will need to restart Pyroscope Server for the configuration to take effect.

### Configuring built-in admin user

Pyroscope Server has a built-in `admin` user with administrative permissions: the account is being created during the
first launch and this can be altered by changing the configuration options:

| Name | Default Value | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| create | true | Indicates whether to create built-in `admin` account. |
| name | admin | Username of the built-in `admin` account. |
| password | admin | Password of the built-in `admin` account. |
| email | admin@localhost.localdomain | Email of the built-in `admin` account. |

In particular, the user creation can be disabled:
```yaml
auth:
  internal:
    admin:
      create: false
```

After the server started for the first time, the admin user can't be changed via the configuration. You can reset the
admin password using the following command:

```bash
pyroscope admin user reset-password --username {admin-username} --password {new-password}
```

Specify `--enable` flag to enable the user, if required.
