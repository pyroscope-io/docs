This guide will help you install **Pyroscope Agent** on <FontAwesomeIcon color="#0db7ed" icon={faWindows}/> Windows.


:::note
Pyroscope supports **Pyroscope Agent** on Windows for those versions of Windows 10 that are still within Microsoftâ€™s [servicing timeline](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet).
:::

## Install

**Pyroscope Agent** for Windows is distributed as an MSI package. To install it locally, start PowerShell **as
Administrator** and run the following commands.

Download package:
<CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
  {
    `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12"\n` +
    `wget https://dl.pyroscope.io/release/pyroscope_agent_${Object.keys(packages.releases)[0].substr(1)}_amd64.msi ` +
    `-outfile pyroscope_agent_${Object.keys(packages.releases)[0].substr(1)}_amd64.msi`.replace(/^\s+/mg, "")
  }
</CodeBlock>
<br/>

Install MSI package with `msiexec`:
<CodeBlock className="language-shell">
  {
    `msiexec.exe /i pyroscope_agent_${Object.keys(packages.releases)[0].substr(1)}_amd64.msi`.replace(/^\s+/mg, "")
  }
</CodeBlock>
<br/>

## Verify the installation

To verify **Pyroscope Agent** was installed correctly, try the `pyroscope` command:
```shell
pyroscope
```

:::tip
After installation, you may need to reload environment variables or re-open the shell:
```shell
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")
```
:::

You should see output, similar to the following:
```

### System service

**Pyroscope Agent** is installed as a system service which is started automatically ([`pyroscope agent`](agent-configuration-agent.mdx) command). To make sure the service was
installed correctly, query its state with PowerShell:

```shell
Get-Service pyroscope
```

You should see output, similar to the following:
```
Status   Name               DisplayName

```

### Logging

When is running as a service on Windows, **Pyroscope Agent** writes logs to
`%PROGRAMDATA%\Pyroscope\Pyroscope Agent\pyroscope-agent.log` file by default.

If agent fails to initialize and start, it writes a corresponding event to Windows Event Log `Windows Logs/Application`
with `Source` field value "Pyroscope".
