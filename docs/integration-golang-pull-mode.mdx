Modern observability systems generally fall into two categories: those where services push data, and those where the
observability system pulls data from services. We find that both approaches are suitable: they both have advantages
and disadvantages, and one of them can be more desirable than another under certain circumstances.

Pyroscope server can operate in both Pull and Push modes. The current implementation makes extensive use of Prometheus
scrape and service discovery mechanisms. We express our deep gratitude to Prometheus team for their incredible work!

:::note
Pyroscope Pull mode is in early development stage and should be considered as a Feature Preview.

## Supported languages and platforms

Any application that exposes data in [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md) format via HTTP can be set as a remote profiling target.

## Scrape configuration

Pyroscope uses exactly the same mechanisms as Prometheus does in order to ensure smooth user experience. Therefore, it
is configured in almost identical way, and [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
can be used as a reference.

:::note
Pyroscope follows `dash-case` YAML naming convention.

A set of static targets is defined as follows:

```yaml
static-configs:
  - application: my-application-name
    targets:
      - hostname:6060
    labels:
      env: dev
```

:::note
 * `application` is the name of the application being profiled. Mandatory field.
 * `targets` lists application instances. It is important to avoid mixing profiles of different applications.

### Profiles configuration

> pprof is agnostic to the profile semantics. . . . The interpretation of the reports generated by pprof depends on the semantics defined by the source of the profile
([__pprof authors__](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md#pprof-profiles)).

Pyroscope can pull `pprof` profiles of any type (such as CPU samples, heap allocations, etc) but requires them to be
explicitly described and enabled. Every scrape job explicitly lists which profiles will be pulled in the
`enabled-profiles` parameter. Profiles listed in `enabled-profiles` refer to configurations present in `profiles`.

Default configuration only includes Go `cpu` and `mem` profiles but eventually we will extend the list.
This means that if you want pulling, for example, Go `goroutine` profiles, you will need to explicitly instruct
Pyroscope how to interpret the data:
```yaml
profiles:
  # Profile name that will be referenced from 'enabled-profiles' option.
  goroutines:
    # URL path. Mandatory field.
    path: /debug/pprof/goroutine
    # URL parameters. The value is a string array.
    params:
      seconds: ['10']
    # A profile can include samples of more than one type. For example,
    # Go 'heap' profile includes: inuse_objects, inuse_space, alloc_objects,
    # and alloc_space.
    # Only explicitly listed sample types are retrieved from the profile.
    # At least one sample type should be configured.
    sample-types:
      # Sample type name as specified in the profile.
      goroutines:
        # Fully qualified application name displayed in UI includes sample type:
        # <application_name>.<sample_type>. Optional.
        display-name: goroutines
        # Sample units. Optional.
        units: objects
        # The field specifies how the profile should be aggregated when queried:
        # if the profile represent the current state (for example, memory in use
        # or goroutines dump), 'average' is the most appropriate aggregation.
        # Supported values: average, sum. Defaults to 'sum'.
        aggregation: average
        # If samples represent accumulated value (for example, alloc_space in Go
        # heap profile shows allocated memory in bytes since the program start),
        # the field should be set to 'true'. Defaults to 'false'.
        cumulative: false
        # If values are sampled, the field should be set to true. For example,
        # Go CPU profile: when CPU profiling is enabled, the Go program stops
        # about 100 times per second and records a sample consisting of the
        # program counters on the currently executing goroutine’s stack.
        # If set to 'true', the profile must contain Period duration value.
        # Defaults to 'false'.
        sampled: false
```

After configuring `goroutines` profile, it can be added to the `enabled-profiles` list.

Default profiles configuration:
```yaml
profiles:
  cpu:
    path: /debug/pprof/profile
    params:
      seconds: ['10']
    sample-types:
      samples:
        display-name: cpu
        units: samples
        sampled: true
  mem:
    path: /debug/pprof/heap
    sample-types:
      inuse_objects:
        units: objects
        aggregation: avg
      inuse_space:
        units: bytes
        aggregation: avg
      alloc_objects:
        units: objects
        cumulative: true
      alloc_space:
        units: bytes
        cumulative: true
```

### Service Discovery

Pyroscope creates pull targets based on the discovered labels. At least `__name__` and `__address__` labels must be
present, where `__name__` is the name of the application being profiled.

Optional labels:
* `__scheme__`: If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need to set this to `https`.
* `__port__`: Scrape the target on the indicated port.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_enabled`: Indicates whether a particular profile should be scraped.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_path`: Specifies URL path exposing pprof profile.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_param_{param_key}`: Overrides scrape URL parameters.

Where `{profile_name}` must be a valid profile configuration name.

At this point, Pyroscope fully supports only [Kubernetes Service Discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config).

## Examples

### Static targets

You can find an example of how Pyroscope scrapes static targets in
[the pyroscope repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/pull/static).

### Kubernetes pods discovery

You can see how Pyroscope discovers remote targets in Kubernetes using
[the example setup](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/pull/kubernetes) in the pyroscope repository.

:::note
Kubernetes Service Discovery requires RBAC set up. Please refer to
[Pyroscope helm chart](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/helm-chart) for details.
