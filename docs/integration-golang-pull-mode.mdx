Modern observability systems generally fall into two categories: those where services push data, and those where the
observability system pulls data from services. We find that both approaches are suitable: they both have advantages
and disadvantages, and one of them can be more desirable than another under certain circumstances.

Pyroscope server can operate in both Pull and [Push](/docs/golang) modes. The current implementation makes extensive use of Prometheus
scrape and service discovery mechanisms. We express our deep gratitude to Prometheus team for their incredible work!

## Supported languages and platforms

Any application that exposes data in [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md) format via HTTP can be set as a remote profiling target.

## Scrape configuration

Pyroscope uses exactly the same mechanisms as Prometheus does in order to ensure smooth user experience. Therefore, it
is configured in almost identical way, and [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
can be used as a reference.

You will need to add the following content to your `pyroscope/server.yml` Pyroscope config file. See the [Server config documentation](/docs/server-configuration#configuration-file) for more information on where this config is located by default on your system.

```yaml
---
# A list of scrape configurations.
scrape-configs:
  # The job name assigned to scraped profiles by default.
  - job-name: pyroscope

    # The list of profiles to be scraped from the targets.
    enabled-profiles: [cpu, mem]

    # List of labeled statically configured targets for this job.
    static-configs:
      - application: my-application-name
        targets:
          - hostname:6060
        labels:
          env: dev
```

:::note
 * `application` is the name of the application being profiled. Mandatory field.
 * `targets` lists application instances. It is important to avoid mixing profiles of different applications.
:::

### Service Discovery

Pyroscope creates pull targets based on the discovered labels. At least `__name__` and `__address__` labels must be
present, where `__name__` is the name of the application being profiled.

Optional labels:
* `__scheme__`: If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need to set this to `https`.
* `__port__`: Scrape the target on the indicated port.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_enabled`: Indicates whether a particular profile should be scraped.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_path`: Specifies URL path exposing pprof profile.
* `__profile_{profile_name}_param_{param_key}`: Overrides scrape URL parameters.

Where `{profile_name}` must be a valid profile configuration name.

At this point, Pyroscope fully supports only [Kubernetes Service Discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config).

## Examples

### Static targets

You can find an example of how Pyroscope scrapes static targets in
[the pyroscope repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/examples/golang-pull/static).

### Kubernetes pods discovery

You can see how Pyroscope discovers remote targets in Kubernetes using
[the example setup](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/golang-pull/kubernetes) in the pyroscope repository.

:::note
Kubernetes Service Discovery requires RBAC set up. Please refer to
[Pyroscope helm chart](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/helm-chart) for details.
