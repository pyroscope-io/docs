To enable Github OAuth2 you must register your application with Github. Github will generate a client ID and secret key for you to use.

## Create Github OAuth keys

First, you need to create a Github OAuth Application. Follow these instructions:


1. Go to https://github.com/
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click "Settings".
1. In the left sidebar, click "Developer settings".
1. In the left sidebar, click "OAuth Apps".
1. Click "New OAuth App".
1. In "Application name", type "Pyroscope".
1. In "Homepage URL", type the full URL to your app's website.
1. Optionally, in "Application description", type a description of your app that users will see.
1. In "Authorization callback URL", type https://pyroscope.mycompany.com/auth/github/callback. Make sure to replace https://pyroscope.mycompany.com with the URL of your Pyroscope instance.
1. Click "Register application".
1. Go to https://console.cloud.github.com/apis/credentials.
1. Click "Create Credentials", then click "OAuth Client ID" in the drop-down menu.

For the most recent version of these instructions visit [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).


## Enable Github OAuth in Pyroscope

Specify the Client ID and Secret in the Pyroscope configuration file. For example:

```
auth:
  github:
    enabled: true
    client-id: CLIENT_ID
    client-secret: CLIENT_SECRET
    allowed-organizations:
      - mycompany
      - myorganization
```

See the [server configuration](configuration.mdx) page for more details on the Pyroscope configuration file.

Restart the Pyroscope server. You should now see a Github login button on the login page. You can now login with your Github accounts.
