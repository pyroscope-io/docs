## Code Map

Pyroscope consists of 2 core components:
* webapp, mostly JS code, UI for the web application
* go code, this is all the backend code including profiling code and the storage engine.




### `Makefile`

Used as a collection of shortcuts, e.g `make build` or `make server`

### `examples`

`docker-compose` examples for integrations with different languages.

### `pkg`

Main place for the go code. We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go. See [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide) for more information on various style guides we use.


### `pkg/agent`

Code that does the actual profiling.

### `pkg/exec`

Code for `pyroscope exec`. Mostly code related to command line interface.

### `pkg/server`

Server related code, mostly HTTP controllers.

### `pkg/storage`

Storage code. Heavy on various tree-like data structures, low level database things.

### `cmd/pyroscope`

Place for command line interface initialization code.

### `tools`

Place where we define the developer dependencies for go code. Kind of like `devDependencies`, but for Go.

### `webapp`

This is where the webapp lives.

### `scripts`

Location for various helper programs / scripts.

### `scripts/packages`

Helper code / files we use to make releases and generate packages for Linux / macOS. See [Downloads](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/releases) page for more information.

### `third_party/rustdeps`

Pyroscope depends on a few rust projects, particularly `rbspy` and `py-spy`.
