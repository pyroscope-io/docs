### `pyroscope connect`

The command attaches profiler to already running process specified by PID or operating system, if applicable (for example, `ebpf` integration).

### Command line arguments

The arguments are the same as for `pyroscope exec` except that `pyroscope connect` requires `-pid` to be specified:

```
Explicitly specified tags take precedence.
