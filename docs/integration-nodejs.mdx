Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
Pyroscope use internal V8 profiler to collect profiling data

#### Supported platforms

| Spy Name     | Type         | Linux | macOS | Windows | Docker |

### Profiling NodeJS application

:::important
This current version of the NodeJS integration requires you to run pyroscope server version `0.15.4` or higher.
:::


To start profiling a NodeJS application, you need to include the npm module in your app:
```
npm install @pyroscope/nodejs

# or
yarn add @pyroscope/nodejs

```

Then add the following code to your application:

```javascript
const Pyroscope = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');

Pyroscope.init({
  serverAddress: 'http://pyroscope:4040',
  appName: 'myNodeService'
});

Pyroscope.start()
```

### Tags

It is possible to add tags (labels) to the profiling data. These tags can be used to filter the data in the UI. Dynamic tagging isn't supported yet

```javascript
Pyroscope.init({
  serverAddress: 'http://pyroscope:4040',
  appName: 'myNodeService',
  tags: {
    region: ENV['region']
  }
});

Pyroscope.start()
```


### Troubleshooting

You may set `DEBUG` env to `pyroscope` and see debugging information which can help you understand if everything is OK.

```bash
DEBUG=pyroscope node index.js
```

### Pull Mode

NodeJS integration also supports pull mode. For that to work you will need to make sure you have profiling routes (`/debug/pprof/profile` and `/debug/pprof/heap`) enabled in your http server. For that you may use our `expressMiddleware` or create endpoints yourself
```javascript
const Pyroscope, { expressMiddleware } = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');

Pyroscope.init({...})

app.use(expressMiddleware())
```

Note: you don't need to `.start()` but you'll need to `.init()`

#### Scrape configuration

You will need to add the following content to your `pyroscope/server.yml` Pyroscope config file. See the [Server config documentation](/docs/server-configuration#configuration-file) for more information on where this config is located by default on your system.

```yaml
---
# A list of scrape configurations.
scrape-configs:
  # The job name assigned to scraped profiles by default.
  - job-name: pyroscope

    # The list of profiles to be scraped from the targets.
    enabled-profiles: [cpu, mem]

    # List of labeled statically configured targets for this job.
    static-configs:
      - application: my-nodejsapp-name
        spy-name: nodespy 
        targets:
          - hostname:6060
        labels:
          env: dev
```

:::note
 * `application` is the name of the application being profiled. Mandatory field.
 * `spy-name` should be set to `nodespy` for NodeJS applications . Mandatory field.
 * `targets` lists application instances. It is important to avoid mixing profiles of different applications.
