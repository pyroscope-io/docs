Pyroscope allows profiling tests and uploading to Pyroscope Cloud.
Its functionality is available via the `pyroscope-ci` binary.

The process consists of 3 steps: Setup, Execution and Upload.

## Installation
The `pyroscope-ci` binary is available under the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/ci/releases).
A handy install script automates the installation process:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyroscope-io/ci/main/install.sh | sh
```
(feel free to download and inspect the script's content, and also pin to a fixed commit)

For Github Actions we recommend using [`jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release`](https://github.com/jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release)

## Setup
Each language/testing framework will have a different setup. Most of them
can be manually added. For the more complicated cases (such as go), a `install` subcommand is available.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="go">
  Running

  ```bash
  pyroscope-ci go install --applicationName=myapp pkg
  ```

  Will recursively under `pkg` find all the packages with tests.
  Then for each package, a new `pyroscope_test.go` will be created, containing
  the agent code for that test package to be profiled.

  We recommend running as a ci step, so that you don't have to commit these files,
  and consequently make your tests slower when running locally.

</Tabs>

## Execution
After your tests have been set up, it's time to execute them:

```bash
pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey="MY_API_KEY" -- go test ./...
```

Notice that any command can be set (`make test`, `./test.sh` etc).

This command:
1. It starts an in-memory pyroscope server;
2. Overwrites the `PYROSCOPE_ADHOC_SERVER_ADDRESS` environment variable, so that the in-memory server ingests the data. 
(Please check if the agent you are using supports that feature.)
3. Uploads to `--serverAddress` (defaults to `https://pyroscope.cloud`)

:::note
Some CI systems will skip certain tests if the files have not been touched.
If you don't want that behaviour, try to run your tests without cache. For reference, in go you can use `go test . -count=1`
:::

## Upload
:::note
This functionality is only available in [Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/ci)
:::

As previously mentioned, the `exec` command also performs upload, but let's dive into it separately,
since it's conceptually a different step.

The CI Context (branch, commit) will be inferred from the environment.
If your the auto detection service doesn't work with your CI system, you can pass each flag manually (`--branch` and `--commitSHA`).

All the data gathered while your tests were running will be merged and grouped by profile type, which is then uploaded.

Alternatively, the `--noUpload` flag can be passed, which creates profiles in the `--outputDir` (defaults to `./pyroscope-ci`).
These profiles can be uploaded to [www.flamegraph.com](https://www.flamegraph.com),
either via the [API](https://flamegraph.com/openapi) or using the [flamegraph.com Github Action](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/flamegraph.com-github-action).

## Visualizing profiles
The profiles can be visualized in the [CI page under Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/ci).

For illustration, above is the profile for `github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope` go tests,
which shows that the race condition detector (`racecall`) spends a non-negligible amount of time.
