# Running Pyroscope in a CI/CD pipeline

If you're running tests in a CI/CD pipeline, you can use Pyroscope to profile your tests and upload the results to Pyroscope Cloud.
This allows you to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.

To use Pyroscope in a CI/CD pipeline, you'll need to install the `pyroscope-ci` binary. This binary provides the functionality for
profiling tests and uploading the results.


## Installation
The `pyroscope-ci` binary can be downloaded from the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/ci/releases).
A convenient installation script is available to automate this process:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyroscope-io/ci/main/install.sh | sh
```
You can also download the script and inspect its contents before running it. We recommend pinning the installation to a fixed commit.

After running the installation script, you'll have access to the `pyroscope-ci` binary in your project. You can run it using:
```
./pyroscope-ci [COMMAND]
```

If you're using Github Actions, we recommend using [`jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release`](https://github.com/jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release) action to install the `pyroscope-ci` binary.
For a more complete example see the [Integrating with Github Actions](#integrating-with-github-actions) section below.

## CI profiling steps
To use Pyroscope in your CI/CD pipeline, you'll need to perform three steps: setup, execution, and upload.

1. **Set up tests with Pyroscope:** In this step, you'll initialize Pyroscope and start profiling. This is typically done in a setup script that runs before your tests.
2. **Run test suite:** In this step, you'll run your tests while Pyroscope is profiling them. Pyroscope will record performance data for each test.
3. **Upload/export results:** In this step, you'll upload or export the profiling data. This allows you to view the data and analyze the performance of your code.

The following sections provide language/testing framework specific instructions for each of these steps:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
    {label: 'Nodejs (jest)', value: 'nodejs-jest'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="go">

  ## Set up Profiling for Go tests

  To profile your Go tests with Pyroscope, you can use the `./pyroscope-ci go` command.
  This command will recursively search for all Go test packages under the `pkg` directory, generate a `pyroscope_test.go` file for each package,
  and instrument the test functions with the Pyroscope agent.

  Here's an example of how to use pyroscope-ci go to profile your tests:
  ```bash
  # Note you may need to pull the `pyroscope` dependency, if you are not using it yet.
  # go mod tidy
  ./pyroscope-ci go install --applicationName=myapp pkg
  ```

  Note that the `--applicationName` flag specifies the name of the application being profiled.

  We recommend running as a CI step, so that you don't have to commit these lines and profile tests when running locally.

  That's it! Pyroscope will now profile your tests in your CI/CD pipeline.

  ## Set up profiling for Node.js tests
  To use Pyroscope with Node.js, you'll need to install the `@pyroscope/nodejs` agent. You can do this via npm or yarn:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @pyroscope/nodejs
  # or
  yarn add --dev @pyroscope/nodejs
  ```

  ### Setting up Pyroscope in Node
  To set up Pyroscope, you'll need to create two new files in your project (or edit them if they already exist):

  1. `globalSetup.js`: This file initializes Pyroscope and starts profiling. 
  Pyroscope will only profile your code when the CI environment variable is turned on. Here's an example:
  ```js
  const Pyroscope = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');

  module.exports = () => {
    Pyroscope.init({
      serverAddress: '_',
      appName: 'myapp.frontend',
    });
    if (process.env.CI) {
      Pyroscope.start();
      // Pyroscope.startCpuProfiling(); // Use this for better performance if heap profiling isn't needed
    }
  };
  ```
  If you don't care about heap profiling, you can replace `.start()` with `.startCpuProfiling()` to reduce the performance overhead.

  2. `globalTeardown.js`: This file stops profiling and exports the profiling data. Here's an example:
  ```js
    const Pyroscope = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');
    module.exports = (config) => {
      if (process.env.CI) { // Note: be sure to set this ENV variable
        Pyroscope.stopCpuProfiling();
        Pyroscope.stopHeapProfiling();
      }
    };
  ```
  Notice how we conditionally start Pyroscope when the `CI` environment variable is set to `true` so that by default we
  don't profile tests when running locally.


  ### Configuring Jest
  To tell Jest to use these files for configuration, add the following to your `jest.config.js` file:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ...
    globalSetup: '<rootDir>/globalSetup.js',
    globalTeardown: '<rootDir>/globalTeardown.js',
    // ...
  }
  ```
  That's it! Pyroscope will now profile your tests in your CI/CD pipeline.

</Tabs>

## Running test suite with Pyroscope
After your tests have been set up, it's time to execute them:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
    {label: 'Nodejs (jest)', value: 'nodejs-jest'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="go">

  ## Profiling Go test suite

  For CI profiling we offer two methods for viewing results after running the test suite:
  1. **(Option 1) Export test results locally**: Use this option for local debugging / development to see a quick result
  2. **(Option 2) Upload test results to Pyroscope cloud**: Use this option for production test suite to track changes over time


  In Go, you can use the following commands to run tests with Pyroscope:

  ### Option 1: Export test results locally
  ```bash
  CI=true ./pyroscope-ci exec --noUpload --export -- go test ./...
  ```
  This will create profiles in the `--outputDir` (defaults to `./pyroscope-ci`).
  These profiles can be uploaded to [www.flamegraph.com](https://www.flamegraph.com),
  via the [UI](https://www.flamegraph.com), the [API](https://flamegraph.com/openapi) or using the
  [flamegraph.com Github Action](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/flamegraph.com-github-action).

  ### Option 2: Upload test results to Pyroscope cloud
  ```bash
  # Note: Make sure to set environment variable CI=true in your test runner
  ./pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey="MY_API_KEY" -- go test ./...
  ```


:::note
Some CI systems will skip certain tests if the files have not been touched.
To avoid this, you can run your tests without cache using the `-count=1` flag.

  ## Profiling jest test suite

  For CI profiling we offer two methods for viewing results after running the test suite:
  1. **(Option 1) Export test results locally**: Use this option for local debugging / development to see a quick result
  2. **(Option 2) Upload test results to Pyroscope cloud**: Use this option for production test suite to track changes over time


  After your tests have been set up, it's time to execute them. Here's how to run your tests with jest:

  ### Option 1: Export test results locally
  ```bash
  # npm
  CI=true ./pyroscope-ci exec --noUpload --export -- npm run test --runInBand

  # or yarn
  CI=true ./pyroscope-ci exec --noUpload --export -- yarn run test --runInBand
  ```
  This will create profiles in the `--outputDir` (defaults to `./pyroscope-ci`).
  These profiles can be uploaded to [www.flamegraph.com](https://www.flamegraph.com),
  via the [UI](https://www.flamegraph.com), the [API](https://flamegraph.com/openapi) or using the
  [flamegraph.com Github Action](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/flamegraph.com-github-action).

  ### Option 2: Upload test results to Pyroscope cloud
  ```bash
  # Note: Make sure to set environment variable CI=true in your test runner
  # npm
  pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey="MY_API_KEY" -- npm run test --runInBand

  # or yarn
  pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey="MY_API_KEY" -- yarn run test --runInBand
  ```

  Make sure to include the `--runInBand` flag so that the profiling session started in globalSetup.js is available to all tests.
  Otherwise, jest will spawn different workers without the ability to perform individual setup/teardown.

:::note
Some CI systems will skip certain tests if the files have not been touched.
To avoid this behavior, you can try running your tests without cache using the `--no-cache` flag.

## Viewing test suite profiles in Pyroscope Cloud

While testing you may try exporting profiling locally, but in practice we've built tooling around profiles for your test suites that makes
optimizing and improving test suites convenient. 

The CI Context (branch, commit) are all inferred from the environment.
If your auto detection service doesn't work with your CI system, you can pass each flag manually (`--branch` and `--commitSHA`).

All the data gathered while your tests were running will be merged and grouped by profile type, which is then uploaded to Pyroscope Cloud. 

## Integrating with Github Actions

The following is a simplified example taken from the [`pyroscope` repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-profiling.yaml) using Github Actions:

```yaml
name: CI Profiling

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  js-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.18'
      - name: Install pyroscope-ci
        uses: jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release@v1.5.0
        with: # Grab the latest version
          repo: pyroscope-io/ci
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Install Webapp dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Run tests and upload
        run: pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey=${{ secrets.PYROSCOPE_CLOUD_TOKEN }} yarn test --no-cache --max-workers=1
```

## Visualizing profiles
The profiles can be visualized in the [CI page under Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/ci).

For illustration, above is the profile for `github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope` go tests,
which shows that the race condition detector (`racecall`) spends a significant amount of time.
