Pyroscope allows profiling tests and uploading to Pyroscope Cloud.
Its functionality is available via the `pyroscope-ci` binary.

The process consists of 3 steps: Setup, Execution and Upload.

## Installation
The `pyroscope-ci` binary is available under the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/ci/releases).
A handy install script automates the installation process:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyroscope-io/ci/main/install.sh | sh
```
(feel free to download and inspect the script's content, and also pin to a fixed commit)

It will download the binary locally, which can be accessed via `./pyroscope-ci`.

For Github Actions we recommend using [`jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release`](https://github.com/jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release), for a more complete example see the [Integrating with Github Actions section](#integrating-with-github-actions).

## Setup
Each language/testing framework will have a different setup. Most of them
can be manually added. For the more complicated cases (such as go), a `install` subcommand is available.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
    {label: 'Nodejs (jest)', value: 'nodejs-jest'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="go">
  Running

  ```bash
  pyroscope-ci go install --applicationName=myapp pkg
  ```

  Will recursively under `pkg` find all the packages with tests.
  Then for each package, a new `pyroscope_test.go` will be created, containing
  the agent code for that test package to be profiled.

  We recommend running as a ci step, so that you don't have to commit these files,
  and consequently make your tests slower when running locally.

  Also you may need to pull the `pyroscope` dependency, if you are not using it yet.
  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs-jest">

  First, install the `@pyroscope/nodejs` agent. Via npm:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @pyroscope/nodejs
  ```

  Or yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn add --save-dev @pyroscope/nodejs
  ```

  Then instantiate pyroscope in a  `globalSetup.js` file:
  ```js
  const Pyroscope = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');

  module.exports = (config) => {
    Pyroscope.init({ serverAddress: '_', appName: myapp.frontend' });
    if (process.env.CI) {
      Pyroscope.start();
    }
  };
  ```
  Notice how we conditionally start Pyroscope when the `CI` environment variable is turned on.
  This is so that it doesn't affect when running locally.

  Also, it's possible to replace `.start()` for `.startCpuProfiling()` if you don't
  care about heap profiling, since it may be costly.

  Then let's add a `globalTeardown.js` file:

  ```js
  const Pyroscope = require('@pyroscope/nodejs');

  module.exports = (config) => {
    if (process.env.CI) {
      Pyroscope.stopCpuProfiling();
      Pyroscope.stopHeapProfiling();
    }
  };
  ```

  Now let's tell jest about these new files. In `jest.config.js` add

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    (...)
    globalSetup: '<rootDir>/globalSetup.js',
    globalTeardown: '<rootDir>/globalTeardown.js',
  }
  ```

  Lastly, `jest` needs to run with the `--runInBand` flag.
  This is so that the profiling session started in `globalSetup.js` is available to all tests.
  Otherwise `jest` [spawns different workers without the ability to perform individual setup/teardown](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8708).

  Also you may want to run with the `--no-cache` flag turned on. Otherwise each execution may yield completely different results, depending on what test is being run.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Execution
After your tests have been set up, it's time to execute them:

```bash
pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey="MY_API_KEY" -- go test ./...
```

Notice that any command can be set (`make test`, `./test.sh` etc).

This command:
1. It starts an in-memory pyroscope server;
2. Overwrites the `PYROSCOPE_ADHOC_SERVER_ADDRESS` environment variable, so that the in-memory server ingests the data. 
(Please check if the agent you are using supports that feature.)
3. Uploads to `--serverAddress` (defaults to `https://pyroscope.cloud`)

:::note
Some CI systems will skip certain tests if the files have not been touched.
If you don't want that behaviour, try to run your tests without cache. For reference, in go you can use `go test . -count=1`
:::

## Upload
:::note
This functionality is only available in [Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/ci)
:::

As previously mentioned, the `exec` command also performs upload, but let's dive into it separately,
since it's conceptually a different step.

The CI Context (branch, commit) will be inferred from the environment.
If your the auto detection service doesn't work with your CI system, you can pass each flag manually (`--branch` and `--commitSHA`).

All the data gathered while your tests were running will be merged and grouped by profile type, which is then uploaded.

Alternatively, the `--noUpload` flag can be passed, which creates profiles in the `--outputDir` (defaults to `./pyroscope-ci`).
These profiles can be uploaded to [www.flamegraph.com](https://www.flamegraph.com),
via the [UI](https://www.flamegraph.com), the [API](https://flamegraph.com/openapi) or using the [flamegraph.com Github Action](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/flamegraph.com-github-action).

## Integrating with Github Actions

The following is a simplified example taken from the [`pyroscope` repository](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-profiling.yaml) using Github Actions:

```yaml
name: CI Profiling

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  js-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.18'
      - name: Install pyroscope-ci
        uses: jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release@v1.5.0
        with: # Grab the latest version
          repo: pyroscope-io/ci
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Install Webapp dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Run tests and upload
        run: pyroscope-ci exec --apiKey=${{ secrets.PYROSCOPE_CLOUD_TOKEN }} yarn test --no-cache --max-workers=1
```

## Visualizing profiles
The profiles can be visualized in the [CI page under Pyroscope Cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/ci).

For illustration, above is the profile for `github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope` go tests,
which shows that the race condition detector (`racecall`) spends a non-negligible amount of time.
