## What is eBPF?

At its root, eBPF takes advantage of the kernelâ€™s privileged ability to oversee and control the entire system.
With eBPF you can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel.
To better understand the implications and learn more check out this [blog post](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf)
which goes into much more detail. For profiling this typically means running a program that pulls stacktraces
for the whole system at a constant rate (e.g 100Hz).

As you can see in the diagram, some of the most popular use cases for eBPF are related to Networking, Security,
and most relevant to this blog post -- observability (logs, metrics, traces, and profiles).

## Landscape of eBPF profiling

Over the past few years there has been significant growth in the profiling space as well as the eBPF space and
there are a few notable companies and open source projects innovating at the intersection of profiling and eBPF. Some examples include:

- [Pyroscope](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope)
- [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie)
- [Parca](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca)
- Prodfiler (closed source)

The collective growth is representative of the rapidly growing interest in this space as companies like Pyroscope, Pixie, and Parca all gained a significant amount of traction over this time period.

It's also worth noting that the growth of profiling is not limited to eBPF, the prevalence of profiling tools has grown
to the point where it is now possible to find a tool for almost any language or runtime. As a result, profiling
is more frequently being considered a first-class citizen in observability suites. 

For example, OpenTelemetry has kicked off
efforts to [standardize profiling](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/profiles/0212-profiling-vision.md)
in order to enable more effective observability. For more information on those efforts check out the `#otel-profiling` channel on the CNCF slack!

## Current state of eBPF profiling

There's a wide spectrum of challenges with eBPF profiling that can drastically change the value you're able to receive from utilizing it.
This is a list roughly sorted from "easier" fairly standard functionality to "harder" more advanced functionality:

- Collecting data with low overhead
- Auto-tagging profiles with available metadata
- Finding the best _format_ in which to send profiling data
- Dealing with collecting, storing, and applying symbols
- Finding ways to deal with _lack_ of symbols
- Finding efficient ways to do other kinds of profiling such as memory profiling
- Finding ways to apply tags dynamically and/or arbitrarily

This blog will focus on Pyroscope's unique approach to solving these issues.

## Pros and cons of eBPF profiling vs non-eBPF profiling

When it comes to modern profiling, there are two ways of getting profiling data:

- User-space level: Popular profilers like pprof, async-profiler, rbspy, py-spy, pprof-rs, dotnet-trace, etc. operate at this level
- Kernel-level: eBPF profilers and linux perf are able to get stacktraces for the whole system from the kernel

Pyroscope is designed to be language agnostic and supports all mentioned profiles above with a specific focus on efficient storage and
advanced analysis of _all_ profiles.

Each approach comes with its own set of pros and cons:

## Pyroscope's solution: Merge user-space and kernel profiling

We believe that there's benefits to _both_ eBPF and non-eBPF profiling and our focus long term is to integrate them together seamlessly in Pyroscope.
The cons of eBPF profiling are the pros of non-eBPF profiling and vice versa. We believe that the best way to get the most value out of profiling
itself is to actually combine the two.


### Profiling compiled languages (Golang, Java, C++, etc.)
When profiling compiled languages, like Golang, the eBPF profiler is able to get very similar information to the non-eBPF profiler.
<Tabs
  defaultValue="nativeGolang"
  values={[
    {label: 'Native Golang', value: 'nativeGolang'},
    {label: 'eBPF Golang', value: 'ebpfGolang'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nativeGolang">
    <Flamegraph profileData={GolangNative}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ebpfGolang">
    <Flamegraph profileData={GolangEbpf}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Profiling interpreted languages (Ruby, Python, etc.)
With interpreted languages like Ruby or Python, stacktraces in their runtimes are not easily accessible from the kernel. 
As a result, the eBPF profiler is not able to parse user-space stack traces for interpreted languages. You can see how
the kernel interprets stack traces of compiled languages (go) vs how the kernel interprets stack traces from interpreted languages (ruby/python)
in the examples

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nativePython"
  values={[
    {label: 'Native Python', value: 'nativePython'},
    {label: 'eBPF Python', value: 'ebpfPython'},
    {label: 'Native Ruby', value: 'nativeRuby'},
    {label: 'eBPF Ruby', value: 'ebpfRuby'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nativePython">
    <Flamegraph profileData={PythonNative}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ebpfPython">
    <Flamegraph profileData={PythonEbpf}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nativeRuby">
    <Flamegraph profileData={RubyNative}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ebpfRuby">
    <Flamegraph profileData={RubyEbpf}></Flamegraph>
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### eBPF for cluster-level profiling
For example, using Pyroscope's auto-tagging feature you can get a breakdown of cpu usage by kubernetes metadata. In this case we can see which namespace is consuming the most cpu resources for our [demo instance](https://demo.pyroscope.io/explore?query=rideshare-cluster-ebpf.cpu%7B%7D&groupBy=k8s_pod_namespace&groupByValue=All):

and you can also see the flamegraph representing CPU utilization for the entire cluster:

This is how we profile our applications internally:
- eBPF for our kubernetes cluster
- ruby gem, pip package, go client, and java client _with tags_ for our language microservices and testing suites
- Lambda extension for our lambda functions

## The next evolution: merging kernel and user-space profiling
With the help of our community we've charted out several promising paths to improving our integrations by merging the eBPF
and user-space profiles within the integration.
One of the most promising approaches is using:
- Non-eBPF language-specific integrations for more granular control and analytic capabilities (i.e. dynamic tags and labels)
- eBPF integration for a comprehensive view of the whole cluster

Stay tuned for more progress on these efforts -- in the meantime happy profiling!
