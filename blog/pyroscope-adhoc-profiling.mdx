### When to use Continuous vs Adhoc Profiling

Historically, most profilers have been built for more static or adhoc analysis (i.e. profiling a script) as opposed to Pyroscope's continuous profiling which added the dimension of time. This allows people to do a more continuous analysis (i.e. profiling a server) and jump around to any point in time. 

Over time as we continued to improve on the UI/UX of Pyroscope and [dogfooding our own product](/blog/profile-continuous-profiler) we started to realize that there are a lot of situations where its actually ideal to use profiling in this static manner vs running a profiler continuously. 

- **Profiling servers**: Continuous profiling
- **Profiling scripts**: Adhoc profiling
- **Attaching to a running process**: Adhoc profiling

Our goal is to make Pyroscope a one-stop-shop for *all* profiling needs... And that means supporting all languages, all flamegraph formats, continuously profiling servers, and — the topic of this post — quickly profiling an adhoc script.

### Introducing Adhoc profiling

That being said, we are excited to officially release Adhoc profiling mode for Pyroscope! With this mode you get all the convenience and simplicity of profiling a script and also get the visualization/UI functionality that we’ve built out over the life of Pyroscope.

### Exporting interactive Flamegraph HTML from Pyroscope Adhoc mode

You can use the `pyroscope adhoc` command to profile a script and export an HTML file which contains an interactive profile that you can view, play with, and share with your team. 

For example, to profile a Golang script [like this one](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/examples/adhoc/adhoc-push.go) you simply run:

```sh
pyroscope adhoc go run adhoc-push.go
```
which will produce a folder containing a `.html` file with an interactive flamegraph (for each of the pprof profiles)

This comand will profile the file passed in and then export an html file which looks like the Pyroscope UI, but is **exported as a simple standalone HTML file**:

Note: This html export can also be achieved through the file exported dropdown available in the flamegraph toolbar of your continuous profiling flamegraphs:

This is the simplest way to use Pyroscope adhoc mode and is great for quickly viewing and sharing profiles in a format with more functionality than a simple screenshot. 

### Analyzing Pyroscope-generated Adhoc Flamegraphs
HTML file export allows you to easily share profiles with other people. In addition to that pyroscope permanently stores all of your profiles in the `~/.pyroscope/` directory. This allows you to revisit these profiles later or even compare and / or diff them. In order to do that run:
Pyroscope stores data in the `~/.pyroscope/` directory. If you run:
```
pyroscope server
```
And go to port `:4040`, you will see a web interface that you can use to view and interact with the flamegraphs you have created via the `pyroscope adhoc` command.

### Viewing Flamgraph diffs between two adhoc profiles
Similar to how we have diff view for continuous profiling. Adhoc also supports calculating the diff between two Flamegraphs. 
For now this functionality requires server-side code so it is only available for files saved inthe `~/.pyroscope` directory. However, we plan to improve on this over time (or potentially even compile these functions to [WASM](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/pull/571) — but thats another post for another time).

### Coming soon!
As of right now (Jan 26), adhoc mode is meant for three main use cases:
- Profiling scripts using pyroscope: Running `pyroscope adhoc` command and being able to view/share the resulting flamegraphs
- Viewing profiles exported from pyroscope: Dragging and dropping files that have been exported to `json` format and then analyzing those flamegraphs
- Getting a shareable standalone HTML flamegraph that has the same UI and analysis features as pyroscope web interface

However, over time we plan to expand functionality so that we can support more languages, formats and use cases:
- Supporting drag-and-drop for pprof files
- Adding ability to comment on stored files
- Adding descriptions / annotations to flamegraphs
- Getting a shareable link to flamegraphs
- UI improvements
- and many more! 

Let us know if you have any recommendations for how to improve adhoc mode!
