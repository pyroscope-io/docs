Go 1.20 introduces the concept of "arenas" for memory management, which can be used to improve the performance of your Go programs. In this blog post, we'll take a look at what arenas are, how they work, and how to use them in your own programs.

### What are memory arenas?

A memory arena is a region of memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation. It is a way to manage memory more efficiently by allocating large blocks of memory at once, rather than allocating and freeing small blocks of memory individually.

In simple terms, arenas make it so that a garbage collector has to only keep track of one object (arena), instead of many small objects, and that can result in a significant performance improvement. See image above for a visual representation of how arenas work.

Practically, when using arenas, this is done by allocating a large region of memory called an arena at the beginning of a code segment, allocating objects consecutively in the arena, and then freeing all of the allocated objects at once by freeing the arena at the end of the code segment.

This approach is useful for certain programming patterns, such as serving independent requests in a server, and can reduce garbage collection overhead.

### How do I use memory arenas?

To use arenas in your own programs, you will need to make sure that your program is compiled with the Go 1.20 runtime. You can check the version of the Go runtime by running the following command:

```shell
$ go version
> go version go1.20 linux/amd64
```

You can download the pre-release version of go 1.20 from [official go website](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.20rc3).

Once you have confirmed that you are running Go 1.20 or later, you can start using arenas in your program. Memory arenas are experimental so you will need to enable them by setting the `GOEXPERIMENT` environment variable to `arenas`:

```shell
GOEXPERIMENT=arenas go build main.go
```

#### Working with single structs

Here's a example where we create an arena, allocate one object on it, then free it:

```go
package main

import (
	"arena"
	"fmt"
)

type User struct {
	loginAttempts int
}

func main() {
	a := arena.NewArena()      // create an arena
	user := arena.New[User](a) // allocate one struct on the arena
	user.loginAttempts++       // work with a struct as you normally would

	// After you're done working with structs
	//   on an arena, you can free it
	a.Free()

	// CAUTION: you should never access structs allocated
	//   on an arena after it was freed
	fmt.Printf("this may panic: %d\n", user.loginAttempts)
}
```

#### Slices

Allocating single objects is great, but in practice you will most likely be using arenas to allocate slices. Here's an example of how you can use arenas to do that:

```go
a := arena.NewArena()
defer a.Free()

user := arena.New[User](a)                  // allocate one struct
users := arena.MakeSlice[User](a, 100, 100) // allocate a slice
```

#### Cloning objects back to heap

Sometimes you may want to clone an object back to the heap. This is useful if you want for some objects to outlive a specific arena. Here's a practical example where you have a function that takes a huge blob of data, parses it into a slice of structs, and then returns a single struct from that slice:

```go
func findUserByID(blob []byte, len int, id string) *User {
	// set up an arena
	a := arena.NewArena()
	defer a.Free()

	users := arena.MakeSlice[User](a, len, len) // allocate a slice
	json.Unmarshal(blob, users)                 // parse JSON blob

	for _, user := range users {
		if user.ID == id {
			// arena.Clone allows you to clone
			//   an object back to the heap
			// This way you can reuse it later,
			//   even after an arena was freed
			return arena.Clone[*User](&user)
		}
	}
}
```

### Drawbacks and Tradeoffs

While arenas can provide performance benefits, it's important to consider the trade-offs before using them. The main drawback of using arenas is that when you use arenas you now have to manage memory manually and if you're not careful that may lead to serious problems:

* if you don't free memory correctly you get **memory leaks**
* if you access objects from an arena that has already been freed it may lead to **panics**

Because of these drawbacks, we recommend that you always make sure to profile your program to see if it could benefit from arenas, and experiment with using arenas to see if they result in improved performance.


### When should you use arenas?

Arenas should be used when you have a large number of structs of the same type that are created and destroyed in rapid succession. Common examples include things like parsing large protobuf or JSON blobs. In extreme cases these types of tasks can make garbage collection the bottleneck of your program. Take a look at this flamegraph for example:

<br/>

This program spends 46.68% of its CPU time doing garbage collection. This is a good example of a codebase that could benefit from using arenas. If you could reduce the number of allocations and deallocations, you could cut the CPU time in half and thus improve latency and cut costs.

In general, it's a good idea to profile your program to see if your program suffers from garbage collection overhead. Once you've identified that it does, you can experiment with using arenas to see if they result in improved performance.


### Our Experience with Arenas

At Pyroscope we've been experimenting with Arenas as soon as they came out in a pre-release version.

A large chunk of work that Pyroscope does is parsing profiles in various formats (`pprof`, `jfr`, etc). This has always been one of the most expensive stages of data processing and we've already implemented a lot of performance optimizations in that area.

When go arenas feature first came out [we've decided to try using it](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/pull/1804) on our parsers. Now we allocate an arena per incoming profile and that allows us to significantly reduce the number of allocations garbage collector has to keep track of.

<br/>

In our particular case the CPU utilization associated with garbage collection went from 6.62% to 2.67%, saving about 4% in CPU utilization, which, at our scale, is a significant improvement. In addition to that we saw a significant improvement in the performance of the system, our p99 latency went down 30%. We were able to handle more profiles in real-time, and the system became more stable overall. It was a great success for us and we highly recommend using Go arenas for similar use cases.

### Conclusion

Go 1.20 introduces the concept of arenas for memory management, which can be used to improve the performance of your Go programs. Arenas are particularly useful for managing memory for large numbers of similar small structs. By using arenas, the Go runtime can avoid the overhead of traditional garbage collection. We recommend that you profile your applications and try using arenas to optimize it.
