# CI Profiling with Pyroscope

[ thumbnail ]

Profiling today looks _very_ different than it did just a few years ago. As people move to more cloud-native workloads 
continuous profiling has evolved into a key piece of many companies' observability suites. At Pyroscope, we've been a huge
part of this evolution thanks to an ever-expanding community who has provided great insight into the use cases where profiling
is most valuable and how we can continue to improve that experience. 

As a result, over the past few years we've released several products to help developers improve their applications' performance. 
1. Continuous profiling: Our most popular a tool for continuously profiling your applications accross your entire system and then
storing and querying that data efficiently

2. Adhoc Profiling: In cases where you may not need to _constantly_ profile or perhaps you'd like to save a snapchat of a profile
our adhoc tool allows you to both capture and save specific profiles to later refer to or use for your convenience

3. Profiling Exemplars: Profiles linked to particular meaningful units such as http requests or trace spans

## Introducing CI Profiling:
Now, we're excited to announce the latest addition to the Pyroscope family - CI profiling. Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are critical for modern software development, but they can also be a 
source of frustration and inefficiency. Waiting for long test runs, dealing with frequent failures and timeouts, and wasted 
resources are all common problems associated with CI/CD pipelines. These issues can be compounded when multiple developers 
are working on the same codebase or when teams are working across multiple repositories. That's why we've developed this new feature that can help: Continuous Profiling with Pyroscope in your CI/CD
pipelines.

## How CI Profiling with Pyroscope Solves Common CI/CD Pipeline Problems

### Improved Performance with CI Profiling

That's why we built CI profiling with Pyroscope. By profiling your code as part of your CI/CD pipeline, you can quickly 
identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code for improved performance. This can lead to faster builds, faster 
deployments, and more efficient use of resources.

### Faster Test Execution

With CI profiling, you can identify slow tests and optimize them for faster execution. This can help reduce the amount of 
time spent waiting for tests to complete and increase the speed at which you can iterate on your code.

### Less Test Failures and Timeouts

By identifying performance bottlenecks in your code, you can also reduce the number of test failures and timeouts that occur 
as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This can help ensure that your pipeline is reliable and consistent, allowing you to focus on 
delivering high-quality code.

### Better Resource Utilization

CI profiling can also help optimize resource usage and reduce waste. By identifying code that is using too much CPU or memory, 
you can make targeted optimizations to improve the overall efficiency of your code.

### Early Issue Detection

Profiling your code as part of your CI/CD pipeline can also help with early issue detection. Newly slow test suite runs likely
mean newly introduced code regressions or performance issues. Catching these issues early can help you identify and fix problems 
before they impact your users.

### Improved Collaboration

Finally, CI profiling can also improve collaboration among developers and teams. Sharing profiling results can lead to better
understanding of the codebase and how it can be optimized for improved performance. This can lead to better collaboration and
more efficient use of resources across your organization.
