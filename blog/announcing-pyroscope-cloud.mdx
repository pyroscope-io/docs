# Introducing Pyroscope Cloud

Pyroscope's mission of making profiling a valuable part of every company's observability stack has remained consistent since we started the project in early 2021. Pyroscope has evolved from helping people debug _known_ performance issues in their applications to _also_ helping discover _unknown_ performance issues that are inevitably hiding in every codebase.

For this reason, we've seen our community using Pyroscope in their day-to-day expand to include:
- Application developers: Using Pyroscope to write more performant code, understand their impact on application performance, and debug performance issues
- SREs and Devops engineers: Using Pyroscope to allocate resources more efficiently when scaling infrastructure alongside the business
- Engineering Managers and executives: Using Pyroscope improve collaboration through a shared understanding of their applications' performance and to view performance through the lense of financial costs
- And many more!


## Why we built a cloud service

As our community has grown to include this diverse set of users and use-cases, we've had more people express interest in getting all the benefits of Pyroscope, but without some of the costs that come with self-hosting or the limitations that come with scaling open source tools.

- Companies who have less time/resources to dedicate to setting up Pyroscope
- Companies operating at scale who need an optimized solution that can handle the volume of data that is produced by profiling applications at scale
- Users who are less technical and want a solution that's easy to use and requires little to no configuration
- Users who want access to the latest features and bug fixes as soon as they are released (with zero downtime)
- Users who want additional access to the Pyroscope team's profiling expertise and support (past our community Slack and GitHub)

And from our side, we believe that a cloud product will help us accelerate our mission of making profiling a critical part of every company's observability stack by: 
- Making it easier for more companies to adopt Pyroscope
- Providing more feedback to help prioritize features on our road map
- Providing more resources to invest in Pyroscope's open source projects
- Making it easier to offer integrations with other tools in the observability stack (e.g. Grafana, Honeycomb,  Gitlab, Github, etc.)

## Introducing Pyroscope Cloud GA
Today we are excited to announce the general availability of Pyroscope Cloud, our hosted version of Pyroscope!

Pyroscope Cloud enables you to achieve your observability goals by removing concerns around setup, configuration, and scaling. It's designed to be easy to use and gives you a significant amount of insight into your application's performance with very minimal configuration.

Some notable features for the cloud include:
- Horizontal scalability
- Support for high-cardinality profiling data
- Zero-downtime upgrades
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Compliance with SOC 2
- Extra support options beyond public Slack / Github
- Tracing integrations (Honeycomb, Jaeger, and Tempo)


## Pyroscope Cloud's Major Scaling Improvements
Similar to Pyroscope Open Source Software(OSS), the cloud service is designed to store, query, and analyze profiling data as efficiently as possible. However, certain limitations that fundamentally limit the scalability of Pyroscope OSS (for now) have been removed in Pyroscope Cloud.

When running Pyroscope OSS at scale, eventually people run into the limitations of the Open Source storage engine. It is built around badgerDB, which is an embeddable key-value database written in Go. The reliance on this component makes the OSS version of Pyroscope scale _vertically_ but not _horizontally_.

In the cloud, we replace BadgerDB with a distributed key-value store which allows us more freedom scale Pyroscope horizontally. We leverage many of the techniques used by Honeycomb and many Grafana projects but with particular adjustments made for the unique requirements of profiling data (stay tuned for future blog post on this).

**This means that with Pyroscope Cloud you don't need to worry about limiting the number of applications, profiles, and tags that you need in order to get the most out of Pyroscope!**

## Pyroscope Cloud's Major Features
We've built Pyroscope Cloud with several different use cases in mind:

### Continuous profiling
This feature used for profiling your applications across various environments. Most agents have support for tags which will let you differentiate between different environments (e.g. staging vs production) and other metadata (e.g. pod, namespace, region, version, git commit, pr, etc.). Using single, comparison, or diff view in comobination with these tags will let you easily understand and debug performance issues.

- Which environment is the most expensive?
- How did the performance of my application change between versions?
- What is our most/least frequent code paths?
- Which libraries are consuming the most resources?
- Where is this memory leak originating?
- etc. 


### Adhoc profiling
This feature is used for when you may want to profile something in a more adhoc manner. Most commonly people use this feature to either upload previously recorded profiles or save a profile for a particular script. Where many used to save profiles to a random folder on their computer, they can use our adhoc page to store them more efficiently, share them with others, and view them with the same powerful UI that they use for continuous profiling.

### Tracing exemplars
This feature is used for when you want to correlate profiling data with tracing data. While traces often will tell you _where_ your application is running slow, profiling gives more granular detail into _why_ and what particular lines of code are responsible for the performance issues.

### Profile upload API and analysis UI
Over time we've found that some of the major companies in various sectors have built their own internal profiling systems which often will ultimately dump a large collection of profiles into some storage system like S3. 

[Pyroscope Cloud's API](/docs/server-api-reference) is built to accept many popular formats for profiling data and then store them in a way that is optimized for querying and analysis. This means that you can redirect your existing profiling data to Pyroscope Cloud and then use the same UI that you use for continuous profiling to analyze it.

```shell
curl --fail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer psx-BWlqy_dW1Wxg6oBjuCWD28HxGCkB1Jfzt-jjtqHzrkzI" \
  http://pyroscope.cloud/render\?from\=now-1h\&until\=now\&query\=pyroscope.server.cpu%7B%7D\&format\=pprof
```


## What's Next for Pyroscope Cloud
- CI/CD Integrations (GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, etc.): We've heard many using Pyroscope to profiling their testing suite and we have plans (link) for a UI specifically geared towards analyzing this data
- More integrations (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- More features (Alerting, etc.)


## How to get started with Pyroscope Cloud
### Migrating from Pyroscope OSS
In order to migrate from Pyroscope OSS to Pyroscope Cloud, you can use our [remote write](/docs/remote-write/) feature to send your data to Pyroscope Cloud. This will allow you to continue using Pyroscope OSS while you migrate your data to Pyroscope Cloud.

You can also get started directly with Pyroscope Cloud, by signing up for a free account at [pyroscope.cloud](https://pyroscope.cloud/).
