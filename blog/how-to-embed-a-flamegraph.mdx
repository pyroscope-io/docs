## Stop screenshotting Flamegraphs and start embedding them
Typically a flamegraph is _most_ useful when you're able to click into particular nodes or stack traces to understand the program more deeply.
After several [blog posts](/blog/profile-continuous-profiler/#performance-optimization-1-caching-the-data-in-a-hash-map) where we featured flamegraphs as a key piece of the posts we found that screenshotting pictures of
flamegraphs was missing this key functionality compared to being able to interact with flamegraphs.

As a result, we created [flamegraph.com](https://flamegraph.com) to have a place where users can upload, view, and share flamegraphs.

We recently released an update to flamegraph.com that makes it easy to embed flamegraphs in your blog or website. The steps to embed a flamegraph are:
  1. Upload a flamegraph or flamegraph diff to flamegraph.com
  2. Click the "Embed" button
  3. Copy the "Copy" button to copy the embed code snippet
  4. Paste the embed code snippet into your blog or website

## Example Embedded Flamegraph
After you've pasted the embed code snippet into your blog or website you'll see a flamegraph that looks like this:
<iframe frameBorder="0" width="100%" height="400" src="https://flamegraph.com/share/a8c6e7a9-f360-11ec-bcfa-beb8fdeeb850/iframe?onlyDisplay=flamegraph"></iframe>
<center style={{margin:"10px 20px 20px"}}><i>Try interacting with flamegraph to better understand what's happening in this application</i></center>

## Example embedded Diff Flamegraph
Diff flamegraphs show the diff between two flamegraphs and look like this:
<iframe frameBorder="0" width="100%" height="400" src="https://flamegraph.com/share/6afa6df7-f362-11ec-bcfa-beb8fdeeb850/iframe?onlyDisplay=flamegraph"></iframe>
<center style={{margin:"10px 20px 20px"}}><i>Try interacting with this diff flamegraph to better understand this diff between two flamegraphs</i></center>

## How to upload a flamegraph to flamegraph.com
There are three main ways you can upload a flamegraph to flamegraph.com. 

### Method 1: Exporting a flamegraph directly from Pyroscope
The first method is to use the "export" menu located on the flamegraph:

### Method 2: Profile a static script using `pyroscope adhoc` command
The second method is to profile a script using the `pyroscope adhoc` command ([example](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/adhoc)), export to JSON, and then upload that JSON to flamegraph.com.
This is convenient when you don't need to profile a whole application continuously, but rather would like to see a profile for a specific script.
```
pyroscope adhoc go run adhoc-push.go
# INFO profiling data has been saved to ~/.pyroscope/pyroscope/adhoc.example.go.alloc_objects-2022-06-23-21-37-29.json 
```
This will output a json file which you can then upload to flamegraph.com.

### Method 3: Upload pre-existing pprof or collapsed files
Similar to the json from Method 2, if you already have a pprof file or collapsed flamegraph file you can upload it to flamegraph.com by using the drag-and-drop uploader.
