## How to embed a Flamegraph on your website or blog
After several blog posts where we featured flamegraphs as a key piece of the posts we found that screenshotting pictures of
flamegraphs didn't have the same impact as when its possible to interact with flamegraphs. As a result, we created [flamegraph.com](https://flamegraph.com)
to have a place where users can upload, view, and share flamegraphs.

We recently released an update to flamegraph.com that solves this problem. To embed a flamegraph on your website/blog you need to:

    1. Upload a flamegraph or flamegraph diff to flamegraph.com
    2. Click the "Embed" button
    3. Copy the "Copy" button to copy the embed code snippet
    4. Paste the embed code snippet into your blog or website

## How to upload a flamegraph to flamegraph.com
There are a couple of different ways you can get a flamegraph to upload to flamegraph.com. 

### Exporting a flamegraph from Pyroscope
There are two main ways to export a flamegraph from Pyroscope. The first is to use the "export" mmenu located on the flamgraph:

The second way is to profile a script using the `pyroscope adhoc` command ([example](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/adhoc)), export to JSON, and then upload that JSON to flamegraph.com.
```
pyroscope adhoc go run adhoc-push.go
# INFO profiling data has been saved to ~/.pyroscope/pyroscope/adhoc.example.go.alloc_objects-2022-06-23-21-37-29.json 
```
then you can upload the JSON file to flamegraph.com

and click the "embed" button as shown above.
