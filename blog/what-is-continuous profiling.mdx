What exactly is continuous profiling? Some say it’s a buzzword, while some thinks it’s another shiny, cool tech that would fade away in a few years time. I believe its here to stay.
Before we jump into what continuous profiling means, it’s important you first understand profiling on a basic level.

## Background
Let’s imagine for one second. We own and manage one of the most popular socia media platforms in the world. With millions of daily active usage comes with it a million responsibilities! Operating at that scale means that there should be a team that handles the overall availability of our services.

Operating at that scale means that we end up using a lot of computer resources- storage and CPU. This accounts for 60% of our total monthly expenditure. As a business, it’s very important we optimize for better performance by using as little resources as possible which in turn reduces infrastructure costs.

As engineers, we tend to measure the quality of our code by how well it scaleses. Scalability here basically means, how much CPU are we consuming? How much memory are we using? These are the kind of questions engineering teams ask. And the way they find the answers is by performing an action known as profiling.

## What is Profiling?
According to Wikipedia, Profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Basically, profiling allows you to record and analyze performance data, so as to assess the consumption of available resources and assist in optimizing for better performance.

Profiling is an effective way of understanding which parts of your application are consuming the most resources. It allows engineering teams to build highly performant applications which leads to an increase in customer satisfaction and in turn, provides value for the business.

## What is continuous profiling?
Now, on the other hand, continuous profiling is the same as profiling but with an added functionality- long-term storage. Continuous Profiling adds a dimension of time that allows you to understand your system's resource usage (i.e. CPU, Memory, etc.) over time and gives you the ability to locate, debug, and fix issues related to performance. Continuous profiling thrives in a production environment where application performance data is retrieved and stored over time. This can come in handy during debugging.

## Pyroscope
Pyroscope is an open-source continuous profiling platform that allows you to:
- Find performance issues in your code
- Resolve issues with high CPU utilization
- Locate and fix memory leaks
- Understand the call tree of your application
- Track changes over time

Pyroscope also provides you with multi-language support, ad-hoc profiling, profile sharing, and more.

Now, you might be asking: does this benefits engineering teams that run on large-scale infrastructure alone? No, it doesn’t. In fact, profiling should be adopted by engineering teams of all sizes: small, medium, or large. For small-medium enterprises, profiling your code and applications can save alot of infrastructure costs for you. It helps you narrow down to the different parts of your application or codebase that utilizes resources the most, which in turn allows you to optimize for better performance.
