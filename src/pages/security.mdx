# Application & Data Security

Pyroscope takes security and confidentiality seriously. The purpose of this page is to explain our general security policies and also to highlight the measures we put in place to secure data.

Have a question about something that's not covered here? Send us an email to support@pyroscope.io and we will be glad to answer it.

## Certifications and Compliance

### SOC 2 Type II

We're currently undergoing a SOC 2 Type II audit of our data security and application security practices.

### Penetration Testing

We regularly undergo penetration testing by an independent security firm as part of our SOC 2 process and can furnish findings to customers as required.

### GDPR

GDPR rights requests may be sent to privacy@pyroscope.io.

### Special contracts

We will gladly explore custom DPAs with our customers when required.

## Bug Bounty Program

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities through our [bug bounty program](/bugbounty). This page attempts to cover the most anticipated basic features of our policy; however the devil is always in the details, and it is not practical to cover every conceivable detail in advance. Whenever there is any room for interpretation or judgment, we will rely on our own discretion, informed by the circumstances and your actions.

## Whistleblower

At Pyroscope we have a strong commitment to building and maintaining a culture of transparency and honesty within our organization at all times.
