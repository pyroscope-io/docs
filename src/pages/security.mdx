## Bug Bounty Program

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities through our [bug bounty program](/bugbounty). This page attempts to cover the most anticipated basic features of our policy; however the devil is always in the details, and it is not practical to cover every conceivable detail in advance. Whenever there is any room for interpretation or judgment, we will rely on our own discretion, informed by the circumstances and your actions.

## Whistleblower

At Pyroscope we have a strong commitment to building and maintaining a culture of transparency and honesty within our organization at all times.
